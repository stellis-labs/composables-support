# Solution Merging Module with LLM Token Optimization

**Description:**  
Develop a module that takes a **problem statement** and an **array of solution strings** as input, then intelligently merges them into a single, coherent solution while adhering to LLM token limits. The module must handle large inputs (e.g., solutions totaling 100k+ tokens) and produce a structured, comprehensive report (0-10 pages) by strategically prioritizing, summarizing, and synthesizing information. The implementation must address LLM token limitations and ensure no critical information is lost.

### Key Challenges:
1. **Token Limitations:**  
   - LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3) have fixed input/output token caps (e.g., 128k input, 4k output).
   - Solutions may collectively exceed these limits.
2. **Information Prioritization:**  
   - Identify and retain critical insights while discarding redundant or irrelevant content.
3. **Coherence:**  
   - Ensure the final output is logically structured and reads as a unified solution.

### Proposed Techniques (Engineer May Choose Implementation Strategy):

#### **1. Hierarchical Processing Pipeline:**
   - **Step 1: Chunking & Relevance Filtering**  
     - Split solutions into smaller chunks (e.g., 1k tokens each).  
     - Use embeddings (e.g., `mxbai-embed-large`) to rank chunks by relevance to the problem statement.  
     - Retain only top-*N* chunks that fit within the LLM’s input token limit.  
   - **Step 2: Multi-Stage Summarization**  
     - Summarize chunks in parallel, then recursively combine summaries until a final summary fits the LLM’s output token limit.  
   - **Step 3: Structured Expansion**  
     - Use the summary as an outline and iteratively expand sections with additional details from the original solutions.

#### **2. Graph-Based Synthesis:**
   - Build a knowledge graph where nodes represent key concepts from solutions and edges represent relationships.  
   - Use graph traversal to identify central themes and synthesize them into a coherent narrative.

#### **3. Hybrid Prompt Engineering:**
   - **First LLM Call:**  
     - Task: *"Identify 5 core themes from these solutions and rank them by importance to the problem statement."*  
   - **Second LLM Call:**  
     - Task: *"Write a section for Theme 1 using solutions [X, Y, Z], focusing on [specific criteria]."*  
   - Repeat for all themes and stitch sections together.

#### **4. Iterative Refinement with Validation:**
   - Generate a draft solution, then iteratively:  
     1. Validate against the original solutions for missing critical points.  
     2. Use a smaller LLM (e.g., Mistral) to compress/expand sections as needed.  

#### **5. Token-Aware Dynamic Batching:**
   - Dynamically adjust batch sizes for processing based on remaining token budget.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     while total_tokens > max_limit:
         remove_lowest_scoring_chunk()
     ```

### Requirements:
1. **Input:**  
   - `problem_statement: str`  
   - `solutions: List[str]`  
2. **Output:**  
   - Coherent report (markdown/structured text) covering all key aspects of the solutions.  
3. **Mandatory Features:**  
   - Token optimization to respect LLM limits.  
   - Programmatic relevance scoring (e.g., embeddings, keyword matching).  
   - Configurable chunking strategies (fixed-size, semantic boundaries).  
   - Fallback mechanisms for failed LLM calls (e.g., retry with smaller chunks).  
4. **Non-Functional:**  
   - Modular design to allow swapping of LLMs, embedding models, and chunking logic.  
   - Scalable to handle 100+ solution strings.

### Implementation Guidelines:
1. **Modular Components:**  
   - **Chunker:** Splits solutions into chunks.  
   - **Relevance Scorer:** Ranks chunks using embeddings/similarity.  
   - **Synthesizer:** Merges chunks via LLM calls.  
   - **Validator:** Ensures no critical data is omitted.  
2. **Prioritize Efficiency:**  
   - Cache embeddings and pre-process solutions where possible.  
3. **Use LLMs Judiciously:**  
   - Reserve LLM calls for high-value tasks (e.g., synthesis, validation).  
   - Use smaller models for preprocessing (e.g., Mistral for initial filtering).

### Example Workflow:
**Input:**  
- Problem Statement: *"Reduce server costs for a cloud-based SaaS platform."*  
- Solutions: [*"Use spot instances...", "Optimize auto-scaling...", "Migrate to ARM-based servers..."*]  

**Process:**  
1. Filter solutions to retain top 3 most relevant (e.g., spot instances, auto-scaling, ARM migration).  
2. Summarize each solution into 200 tokens.  
3. Synthesize summaries into a draft report.  
4. Expand each section with specific cost-saving calculations from original solutions.  

**Output:**  
A structured report with sections:  
- **Cost Optimization Strategies**  
  1. Spot Instance Utilization (AWS/GCP examples)  
  2. Auto-Scaling Configuration Best Practices  
  3. ARM Migration: Benchmarks and Savings

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Handles input solutions exceeding 50k tokens.  
2. Produces a coherent report with no missing critical information.  
3. Implements at least one token optimization strategy (e.g., chunking, summarization).  
4. Includes tests for edge cases:  
   - All solutions are redundant.  
   - Solutions contain conflicting recommendations.  
   - Token limits force aggressive truncation.
