PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Foreword
As an industry, equipment leasing and finance continually faces change in its business environment, change
it sometimes embraces and sometimes grudgingly accepts. Industry members have traditionally used var-
ious methods of analysis to help them make critical decisions while navigating these changes. Yet, we now
have an opportunity to improve our decision-making by gathering, analyzing, and using more effectively the
vast amounts of information at our disposal.
Equipment financiers have more data today than ever. Yet, the use of this data in decision-making has not
changed appreciably in that analysis continues to be based on some form of financial-statement output.
This is where the growing use of business intelligence comes in as executives gather and process large
amounts of data and quantify, analyze, and deliver sophisticated reports in real time.
Predictive analytics represents the next step in the evolution of business intelligence. It is also critical to be-
coming a knowledge-based company – a company with knowledge of customers, risks and opportunities.
This study allows readers to preview the processes and expertise necessary to implement predictive ana-
lytics and benefit from the competitive advantages they can create. In our view, equipment finance compa-
nies that proactively embrace predictive analytics and its uses are the ones that will be rewarded in the
marketplace.

Executive Summary
Predictive analytics is an evolving branch of informatics, or information science that considers and analyzes
large amounts of data to help firms better manage risk, improve operations, increase profitability, and make
more insightful decisions. Equipment leasing and finance firms can apply predictive analytics to become
knowledge-based companies that create competitive advantage through improved decision-making.
To achieve its results, predictive analytics employs a variety of statistical techniques that identify and validate
correlations between outcomes and causative variables. Use of these techniques requires enabling tech-
nologies and knowledge of applicable markets. In return, predictive analytics allows users to model the
future under varying assumptions, in each instance answering the critical question, “What if?”
Applying predictive analytics is not simply a matter of data or the technologies to analyze it, however. The
ability to extract useful information from data and make sound decisions based on it is what creates predic-
tive analytics’ value. Developing this ability requires corporate commitment, financial resources and highly
specialized skills.
As of late 2012, equipment leasing and finance firms surveyed for this study reported applying predictive
analytics in three areas of functionality: credit scoring, residual management and portfolio management. Ap-
plication in credit scoring was reported as most developed.
Industry processes for managing asset/collateral risk were not well enough aligned at the time of the study
to leverage the benefits of predictive analytics, and thus, the study suggests actions firms can take to alle-
viate this situation. This is fitting, since surveyed firms indicated that they expect their use of predictive an-
alytics to increase in the coming year, most by leveraging extant capabilities and personnel. Such an
approach should help firms realize early on two primary benefits of predictive analytics: increased efficiencies
and reduced costs.
Given predictive analytics’ shift away from management’s traditional focus on experiential intuition and past
performance, it is important to note that a company’s leadership and culture play key roles in the creation
of a successful predictive analytics program. As one survey respondent observed, “It still takes people to
implement a predictive analytics program, no matter how good the informatics.”
The study answers many questions about the use of predictive analytics within the equipment finance in-
dustry. Yet one vital question remains unanswered: “Will the industry and individual firms within it embrace
predictive analytics and apply it to create a competitive edge?” We hope so. But only time will tell.

About the Study
Businesses have always used analysis to help them make the best decisions possible when faced with a
given set of facts or assumptions. Applying a range of tools from handwritten spreadsheets to sophisticated
software solutions, companies have separated information into multiple components and then examined
and evaluated those components in an effort to maximize profitability and enhance customer satisfaction.
At its most basic, information analysis today takes the form of financial statements and footnotes on those
statements that explain certain aspects of a company’s operations. At a more complex level, information
analysis encompasses a broad range of metrics displayed on electronic “dashboards” and known as “busi-
ness intelligence.” Business intelligence is based primarily on historical data and helps firms understand
past performance and trends. Predictive analytics is the next generation of business intelligence, leveraging
massive amounts of data to predict future performance and trends, allowing businesses to make better-in-
formed decisions.
In the context of deploying this evolving management tool, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation
(“the Foundation”) established this Study. Through it, the Foundation seeks to identify ways in which com-
panies can use predictive analytics to produce information that can be used to make meaningful business
decisions. The Study also considers predictive analytics’ impact upon current industry processes, and dis-
cusses how “PA,” as we shall sometimes refer to it, can be effectively implemented from a business process
and technology perspective. The study also examines the potential benefits that might be expected.
The study further focuses on ways equipment leasing and finance companies are already processing and
leveraging their data through predictive analytics. These insights are reinforced through practical application
of the concepts embodied in the research, and further enhanced through collaboration with industry leaders
in the analytics space that currently offer such services.1
In the Foundation’s view, the key questions every lessor or lender must ask are two: “How can I use predic-
tive analytics to make better decisions?” and “How are my competitors using this powerful data-manage-
ment tool?” We hope the study will help answer these questions for equipment leasing and finance
organizations large and small, both of which contribute significantly to the formation of capital, the success
of other businesses, and growth of the U.S. economy as a whole.

A Business Intelligence Primer
Much business analysis is based on information contained in financial statements. Making sense of this
output, which may come to management as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, is difficult, because it does not come
with a big-picture perspective.
In recent years, however, business intelligence has been employed to reveal not only the big picture, but
details behind key drivers of the business. Such detail is critical for employees undertaking investigative
analyses of the data in the form of drill-downs, aggregations, correlations and other techniques.
Companies create business intelligence by combining information, data, business models, and human in-
sights. They use tools that include standalone or embedded software systems, existing databases, and
presentation capabilities tailored to the users’ needs. Loosely speaking, this intelligence may be analytical,
predictive, or both, and uses internal information to analyze metrics like financial performance, risk, or oper-
ational efficiencies. It then is used to facilitate improved and agile decision-making, helping maximize com-
pany performance and market position.
Unlike traditional management information, business intelligence combines data from numerous sources
and multiple perspectives to provide a single, overarching version of the truth. This approach provides a
holistic view of the business and the integrated analysis that supports the strategic management process.
Traditionally, reporting and analysis of financial and operational data was a manual process that combined
multiple data sources. The process created accuracy issues due to rekeying data, and compatibility prob-
lems when attempting to merge different sources. Business intelligence automates this process, extracting
source data, compiling reports and analyses, and creating important benefits that include quicker report is-
suance, repeatable processes and superior distribution mechanisms.
Activities inherent in the business intelligence process include monitoring performance, such as profitability;
how well the sales force is aligned with profitable opportunities; and analyzing the effectiveness of vendor
or broker programs. Activities also involve modeling and managing processes, the most recognizable of
which in equipment leasing and finance is credit scoring. Companies may choose to use data-mining tech-
niques, stochastic analysis, predictive analysis, modeling, or a combination of these methods to examine
large volumes of data to forecast trends.
According to the ELFA 2011 Business Technology Performance Index (“BTPI”), organizations surveyed use
several business intelligence tools, and a majority aggregate and report data from a data warehouse or
other repository of multiple core applications. More than 25% do not use a business intelligence tool, how-
ever, choosing instead to manually construct reports from the output of various applications.
Top factors driving the use of business intelligence that were identified in the BTPI are business effective-
ness, cost reduction, customer expectations, risk reduction, and statutory obligations, such as bank-report-
ing requirements. Barriers to using business intelligence include data availability, staff skills and training,
user culture, lack of trust, and, to a lesser extent, business processes and organization. Figure 12 illustrates
the evolutionary path a company may travel as it creates a robust and mainstream business intelligence

competency. Also noted are certain tools and capabilities that are required. As can be seen in Figure 1,
predictive analytics is a component of business intelligence used to make predictions of future behaviors
and outcomes. Through its mathematical and statistical methods, predictive analytics represents another
step forward in businesses’ quest to exploit available information.

The Role of Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics is thought of more in terms of arcane methodologies than Academy Award-nominated
motion pictures. But the film “Moneyball” is a case study in predictive analytics. The movie chronicles how
the revenue-constrained Oakland A’s assembled a winning team by using performance indicators that defied
conventional baseball wisdom and experience. Those performance indicators, or scores in this case, were
based on statistical models and a data-driven approach – predictive analytics, in other words.
Although predictive analytics incorporates many of the characteristics of business intelligence, there are
differences. Figure 2highlights some of these differences and represents the evolution of financial reporting
to predictive analytics.

Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques that analyze current, historical, economic,
and even unstructured data such as texts and pictures. This information is used to identify risks and oppor-
tunities and capture relationships among various factors. The results of the analyses are used to make
more accurate predictions about future events and to exploit patterns found in that data, thereby resulting
in better decision making.
A key difference between predictive analytics and traditional decision making is the nature of the information
being considered. Financial statement analysis, for example, looks backwards to determine what happened
in the past, and often results in decisions being reactive to that past. Predictive analytics helps management
look forward and assess how to address future events such as expected customer behavior.
Predictive analytics also requires a range of enabling technologies and detailed knowledge of the applicable
markets. Although advances in technology and computer processing power have enabled development of
powerful predictive models and the processing of large volumes of data, simply having the technologies to
gather, analyze, and store data is not enough for success.
The value of predictive analytics
Predictive analytics is receiving increasing scrutiny within the equipment leasing and finance industry as fi-
nance companies evolve into knowledge-based organizations. Improved information within these organi-
zations allows both executives and front-line staff to make better commercial judgments. This knowledge
includes having the right data to glean the best information about one’s customers, competitors, and own
company, and is essential to generating additional revenue and growth in a competitive environment.
11
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Given today’s pressure to achieve more results with fewer resources, companies now must work even
harder to eliminate inefficiencies. Access to up-to-the-minute information about customers, operations,
funding sources, competitors, and markets is essential to accomplishing this. Applying predictive analytics
to this information can assist businesses in turning this data into a competitive advantage.
While there is much to be said about the value of experience, the pace and complexity of today’s business
environment, along with the massive amounts of data that can be analyzed, require a more dynamic method
of making decisions. Predictive analytics helps increase the agility of the decision-making. In traditional
analytical decision-making, data is collected, synthesized, and passed to top management, who then must
absorb it, formulate responses and disseminate strategies and directives back through the reporting chan-
nel.
Markets are shifting too quickly today for this form of decision-making to be effective. The speed to market
that predictive analytics helps facilitate is a very real competitive advantage. A good example of this benefit
is the equipment finance provider’s ability to credit-score a vendor’s customer in minutes, thereby taking
the transaction off the street and solidifying the vendor’s sale. By doing so, the company increases its value
to the vendor partner and creates a stronger and longer-lasting relationship.
What’s more, predictive models can help compa- “The speed to market that

customers and design marketing programs and re-
tail environments appropriate to each segment.
Similarly, equipment finance companies can use segmentation to launch product campaigns or promotions.
A company might identify distinct marketing segments based on scores that consider a combination of
credit performance, required capital and profitability. The firm could then develop models to reflect the out-
comes of these scored customer behaviors. Once predictive outcomes are generated, the customer seg-
ment with the highest, potential risk-adjusted return on capital could be assigned a salesperson for a
personal visit. The moderately profitable group might be mailed a promotional piece, followed by a telephone
call, while the least profitable group might receive an email with a link to the company’s website.
Another application of predictive analytics in the equipment leasing and finance space is market forecasting.
In a recent project, a finance company client was concerned about the direction of new business, given the
volatility and uncertainty of the economy. The finance company wanted to use available internal data and
external factors to predict potential demand in order to set investment priorities and identify growth markets.
The company incorporated a multidimensional design into the analysis. Dimensions included asset cate-
gories, metrics such as new volumes and market share, external markers like Gross Domestic Product
(“GDP”) and inflation rates, and the time series for both historical and forecast data. Based on this infor-
mation and its goals, the company developed a model that allowed it to predict future new volumes by asset

category and by market. The model also allowed the company to analyze the effect of changes in external
factors on that new volume.
Other areas in which equipment finance companies can use predictive to improve operations, increase prof-
itability, or mitigate risk include:
• Credit scoring and underwriting
• Risk analysis
• Portfolio management
• Strategic planning
• Market analysis
• Customer relationship management
• Cross-selling and up-selling
• Residual value analysis
• Fraud detection
• Collections and delinquency management
• Direct and online marketing
• Asset maintenance
• Customer profitability
Historically, equipment leasing and finance companies have been slow adopters of new technologies and
processes. But this study shows they are beginning to seize upon the benefits of predictive analytics. Just
as transportation systems use predictive models to estimate the likelihood of system interruptions and me-
chanical failures, fleet lessors can use the same models to identify the likelihood of maintenance breakdowns
to assist in fleet selection and planning. Similarly, finance providers can identify vendor deception, just as
the public sector is using predictive analytics to reduce government fraud.
Applying predictive analytics
There is a surfeit of data in most companies, so the ability to extract information from data, recognize its ap-
plication, and then make good decisions is what creates value. Further to this point, the resultant information
must be actionable. All the sophisticated tools and methodologies at one’s disposal are of little value if the
information cannot be used to make good business decisions.
In this regard, predictive analytics should be viewed more as a business activity than an IT activity. IT support
is essential to the process, but the information must be relevant and presented in a way that it can be un-
derstood. If the user cannot relate to the information and perceive its value, it will not be trusted or relied
upon. Dashboards and other focused reporting mechanisms associated with predictive analytics create
value in this area.
Another essential step in developing information that is actionable is establishing the goal of the prediction,
as defined by the business problem to be solved. Goals might include allocating capital, avoiding risk, re-
ducing expense, or retaining profitable customers. For example, a company may want to know if customers
are more likely to continue leasing on a month-to-month basis if an additional follow-up notification call is
made. The income benefits of this information then can be balanced with the cost of the call and any asso-
ciated customer goodwill consequences.
Properly defining the goal of the prediction ensures that the results are actionable and have the intended
impact on business results. This latter determination requires that the prediction results be evaluated and
13
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
redirected, if appropriate. For instance, the targeted customer behavior on which the decision is being
made may not be sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions. Or, there may be flaws in the underlying busi-
ness assumptions. On the upside, such a review may inspire additional insights or applications of the data.
Once the goal of the prediction is defined, a model must be chosen. The model helps develop theories
about how a variable will perform in the future. It also suggests remedial actions through a variety of statistical
techniques. These theories are represented by formulas or algorithms and represent how a given variable
performs.
Formulas must first be used to analyze how the variable performs, based on historical data. In predictive
analytics, the model, through its formulas, correlates the performance of the selected variable to changes
in various factors, which may be internal or external to the company. This correlation is performed through
a variety of statistical techniques.
In the earlier example, a finance company used historical internal and external data to predict new business
volumes by developing a model to analyze its data. Specifically, this model calculated regression statistics
between GDP and changes in lease volume. It then tested the statistical significance of the relationship
between GDP and the changes in lease volume. Once these relationships were established, assumptions
regarding the variables were input, and the model calculated the estimated and forecasted change in leasing
volumes based on applicable GDP levels.
Although an in-depth understanding of these statistical techniques is not necessary, those considering im-
plementing predictive analytics should at least be familiar with some of the technical jargon and terminology,
if not the detail, of these statistical intricacies. A brief overview of some statistical elements of predictive
analytics is presented here as background.
Key elements of predictive analytics that may be used by equipment finance organizations include:
• Descriptive statistics– basic statistics such as means, max-
imum, minimum, frequencies, and cross tabulation “At the end of the day,
• Bivariate statistics – statistics examining the relationship
between sets of numbers, e.g., t-test, ANOVA, correlation, a successful predictive
and non-parametric tests such as Chi-squared
• Regression analysis – establishing the relationship be- model must produce
tween two or more variables, including simple linear regres-
sion, multiple linear regression, and non-linear regression
actionable information.”
• Factor and cluster analysis – techniques for identifying
groups within data sets, e.g., identifying customers most
likely to default or those most likely to churn
• Time series analysis– establishing trends in data over time, measuring seasonality, which is an important
technique for forecasting
• Decision tree models– a valuable technique for analyzing yes/no type data and employed in applications
such as credit scoring
• Monte Carlo simulation – a technique for forecasting a range of outcomes and an important tool in risk
management
• Anomaly detection – the ability to detect extreme or unusual combinations of values within a data set
and a technique that is utilized in fraud detection
• Text analytics– functionality that identifies trends and patterns from unstructured, textual information such
as e-mails, social media, etc.
14
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The predictive elements of a model can profit greatly through the addition of more sophisticated statistical
steps, such as correlation and stochastic analysis. In the real world, each analytical object is affected by a
number of factors or variables, so correlation analysis evaluates the correlation between all the listed vari-
ables. A Pareto plot can then be created to reflect the correlation of a particular variable, such as profitability,
to all other variables.
The predictive analytics process also is iterative, so it will have a strong tendency to suggest further ques-
tions that may not have been anticipated at the beginning of the analysis, such as why credit risks of type
X perform better in territory A than in territory B. A good portion of the value of a model lies in its ability to
perform intelligent ad hoc analysis.
Equipment leasing and finance companies have access today to a diverse range of predictive-analytics
models and software tools that incorporate these requirements, statistical techniques, and forms of analysis.
This broad access has not always been available, although software tools for predictive analytics existed
long before the term.
15
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Review of Predictive Analytical Tools
Predictive analytics software can be categorized into three types:
• Enterprise business intelligence software platforms
• Standalone predictive analytics solutions
• Generic desktop applications
An overview of selected tools
Most enterprise business intelligence platforms are modular, with predictive analytics or statistics available
as one of a set of modules. SAP’s “BusinessObjects”is widely used for financial and management reporting
and also offers a Predictive Analysis module. IBM SPSSis a long established statistical analysis package
that offers a range of statistics modules as well as the SPSS Modeler workbench for predictive analytics.
Like IBM SPSS, another vendor, SAS, is focused strongly on the business analytics market and meets the
requirements of predictive analytics with desktop and server options and an extensive set of data mining
and analysis tools. It also enables predictive models to be developed and shared across the enterprise. In
addition, SAS has developed JMP, a suite of entry-level statistical and predictive-analytics software more
focused on ad hoc investigation by individual users.
Information Builders’ WebFOCUSis more widely used for reporting and business intelligence application,
although it has moved into the data mining and predictive analytics sectors. Another enterprise software
application, TIBCO’s Spotfire, places the emphasis on ease of use and data visualization across its business
intelligence functionality while its Spotfire Analyst option offers an extensive range of predictive analytics
suited to the occasional user, as well as expert power users.
There are several standalone predictive analytics solutions available from a wide range of vendors, including
Oracle and IBM. Angoss Software Corporation’s KnowledgeSTUDIO, MicroStrategy’s BI Platform, and
Rapid Insight’s Analytics are pure-play data mining and business analytics solutions while Statsoft’s Sta-
tisticaprovides analytical and advanced statistical functionality.
Quantrix Modeler, another standalone solution, is aimed primarily at financial modeling, but contains some
statistical functionality and is excellent at handling multidimensional data. The open source statistical pro-
gramming language Ris available as a free download from the R Foundation; paid-for, supported versions
are available from a number of organizations, including Revolution Computing.
Finally there are popular desktop tools, primarily spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice.
These provide a range of statistical and mathematical functions from which basic analysis can be undertaken
and simple predictive models developed. While they lack the rich functionality of dedicated predictive ana-
lytics applications, spreadsheets do provide a familiar and easy-to-use environment for simple model devel-
opment, and at a relatively low cost.
16
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Predictive analytics software requirements
Data-mining: Predictive analytics software should have data-mining functionality to analyze and find rela-
tionships in data, and statistical functionality to develop predictive models on which forecasts and behavioral
assumptions can be made.
Data-visualization: The software also should provide data-visualization capabilities, including the ability to
display simple graphics. Many applications support more complex visualizations, such as interactive dash-
boards, maps, and decision trees.
Visual environment: A number of predictive analytics applications, notably IBM SPSS Modeler, Busines-
sObjects, andWebFOCUS Developer Studioalso provide a visual environment in which to develop models.
This feature assists in the development process and can improve user productivity by placing the emphasis
on discovering insights from the data rather than just writing code.
To qualify as a predictive analytics tool, then, the software must provide statistical and analytic functionality.
This includes basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficients, etc.) and simple modeling,
such as linear regression. Most of the dedicated packages provide much more sophisticated functionality,
however, including predictive capabilities for identifying groups, like factor and cluster analysis; plus fore-
casting and decisioning capabilities, such as multiple linear and non-linear regression modeling, decision
tree models, and Monte Carlo simulation.
Data integration: Another key functional capability for predictive analytics software is data integration, the
tools of which invariably will be used in conjunction with operational data such as originations, credit, delin-
quencies, and so on. The operational data is drawn from transactional systems such as lease administration,
finance and accounting, manufacturing, or banking, and may require extraction from a combination of these
to provide the right data for analysis.
Since transaction data usually is not in a format conducive to analysis, functionality must exist to extract
data from transactional systems, undertake any transformation, aggregation, or sampling required and load
it ready for analysis. Known as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL), this operation sometimes is performed by
a separate specialized toolset that extracts and aggregates the data into a data warehouse. The predictive
analytics (or reporting tools) then interact with the data in the data warehouse instead of with the live trans-
actional system.
Some predictive analytics software can interact directly with lease administration systems or Enterprise Re-
source Planning (ERP) databases, while some of the enterprise business intelligence suites offer ETL mod-
ules that are used to build a database on which their predictive analytics modules then can be applied. At
a minimum level, predictive analytic software needs to import data from other sources, such as Excel spread-
sheets, text files (e.g., CSV file format), and, preferably, relational databases used for transactional systems,
such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.
Examined from another perspective, predictive analytics software requires the user to possess an under-
standing of the analytical and modeling techniques applied, although the level of expertise varies consider-
ably between packages. At one end of the spectrum, as shown in Figure 3, is R, a statistical programming
language aimed at the statistician and expert programmer. R is command-line-driven and sacrifices ease
of use for power and speed, so a solid knowledge of the language is necessary, as there is no user-friendly
graphical interface (other than through third party add-ons).

SAS JMP Pro Excel
At the other end of the usability spectrum are packages such as Quantrix Modeler, TIBCO Spotfire, and
Oracle Crystal Ball. Quantrix Modeleris interesting in that, while it possesses a relatively limited range of
statistical functions (its primary focus is financial modeling), its ability to handle multidimensional data is ex-
tremely user-friendly. It also provides a straightforward approach to building models that are spreadsheet-
like in simplicity, although, unlike spreadsheets, it keeps the model logic separate from the data, making it
much easier to audit.
TIBCO Spotfireemphasizes data visualization that enables non-expert users to easily identify relationships
between data while Oracle Crystal Ball focuses on risk analysis. Crystal Ball provides a rich set of func-
tionality for Monte Carlo simulation, but packages this in a simple, step-wise approach to model-building
that can be easily understood by non-expert users. It also is implemented as an add-in to Microsoft Excel
so the user can work within a familiar environment.
Comparison of selected software tools
The software tools reviewed and compared in this section are listed in Figure 4, and include a broad, rep-
resentative set of tools that meet the range of requirements of leasing companies in terms of functionality,
size of business and type of user. These users will range from specialists, such as statisticians and pro-
grammers, to senior executives basing their decisions on the output of predictive models.
Since many ELFA members are using platforms from Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and IBM, predictive-analytic
solutions from these vendors have been included, along with several independent vendors. Point solutions
from well-established vendors in the sector, plus some low-cost, entry level options, also are reviewed. It
should be noted that this review is not intended to be exhaustive. Many available software tools have not
been included, primarily because they do not offer the requisite statistical or analytical functionality.
Statistical functionality
Statistical functionality, the first core requirement to be reviewed, typically is available in varying degrees,
ranging from basic statistical functions in Excel to extensive and complex functionality in packages such as
SAS, Statistica, and R. Bearing in mind the predictive-analytics requirements of equipment-finance organ-
izations, this section reviews the applications in nine key areas, as indicated in Figure 5.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
All applications reviewed provide descriptive and bivariate statistics, with the exception of BusinessObjects,
which offers limited descriptive statistics only, and Oracle Crystal Ball, which provides these for output fore-
casts only. Crystal Ball is implemented as an add-in to Excel, as is Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services,
so both provide this functionality through Excel functions.
Regression analysis is fully supported by all the applications reviewed with the exception of Quantrix Modeler
and Microsoft Excel. These can implement linear and multiple linear regression models, but are less well-
suited to more complex regression techniques. Quantrix Modeler and Excel also do not support factor/clus-
ter analysis or time-series analysis, although it is possible to build simple time-series models using basic
regression techniques and seasonal analysis in both applications. Of the other applications evaluated, only
Crystal Ball does not provide factor and cluster analysis.
Decision tree functionality is available in eight of the twelve software solutions evaluated, while Crystal Ball,
Quantrix Modeler, SAS JMP Pro, and Excel do not offer this capability. Monte Carlo simulation is less widely
available. Crystal Ball, for example, has extensive capabilities in this area and it also is provided by SAS
JMP Pro, WebFOCUS, R, and Statistica. Basic Monte Carlo simulations can be built using Excel and there
are third party add-ins available that extend its functionality in this respect.
Of the software solutions reviewed, Statistica offers the most complete set of functionality in the areas eval-
uated, while SPSS Modeler lacks only Monte Carlo simulation, although it is available in other SPSS mod-
ules. Quantrix Modeler and Excel are the most limited in terms of statistical functionality, as these are more
general purpose solutions not specifically aimed at predictive analytics.
Usability and data visualization
Usability was assessed in terms of the type of interface available and the extent to which the interface meets
the needs of different types of users, as summarized in Figure 6. All the software packages reviewed offer
a GUI (graphical user interface) with the exception of R, which is command-line-driven only. However, some
third party add-ons are available that provide a limited GUI to R functionality. Apart from R, only Microsoft
SQL Server Analysis Services provides a command-line interface although, unlike R, it also has a GUI al-
ternative. Some packages also can be integrated with spreadsheets, thereby providing users with a familiar
interface.
Some of the software solutions reviewed provide a graphical environment for model development. This
typically is represented as a visual workbench in which data sources, statistical/modeling functionality, vi-
sualization, and model outputs are represented as icons. Graphic functionality is valuable where complex
models are developed using multiple data sources, and where models are run on a regular basis or have to
be replicated for multiple users.
The graphic environment enables developers to focus on the business requirement and process in building
predictive models without requiring them to learn a programming language. Models also can be more easily
understood and audited by other users in such an environment. This graphic development environment is
featured mainly in the enterprise business intelligence software suites with BusinessObjects, SPSS Mod-
eler, Microsoft SQL Server, WebFOCUS (through the optional Developer Studio module), SAS Enterprise
Miner, and Statistica offering this capability.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Data visualization is a key requirement of any predictive analytics solution, and all the software systems pro-
vide simple data visualization with standard bar, line, pie, scatter charts, etc., while most provide more com-
plex visualizations, including dashboards, maps and decision trees. Microsoft SQL Server, Excel, and
Quantrix Modeler are the only three solutions that are limited in this respect.
Various types of users are likely to be involved in developing predictive analytics models. They will include
specialists such as statisticians and programmers, as well as more generalist power users or analysts and,
potentially, executives. Clearly, statisticians are likely to be capable of using all of the software solutions re-
viewed, although Quantrix Modeler and Excel are unlikely to provide the statistical functionality that this
level of expertise would require. Figure 7 correlates the software tools with the most appropriate user
focus.

Programmers may be employed in model development when there is a requirement to integrate the model
with other business applications, such as real-time credit scoring, but also may be employed when complex
models are constructed using a programming language, such as SAS or R. Programming skills may also
be required in applications such as Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services, in which additional database
administration expertise is required, or in applications that provide predictive analytics capabilities through
embedded R, such as WebFOCUS Rstat.
Most of the applications have been developed with non-specialist users in mind so power users and analysts
should be capable of using the systems for data mining and model development. Statistical software tools
typically will not be adopted by executive users without a background or training in predictive analytics,
however, given the specialization, power, and complexity of the applications. R is the only application that
presents more of a challenge, as it has a steep learning curve and a user interface with which most users
are unlikely to be familiar.

Despite this, there are some applications that can be utilized by users with typical Excel-level skills. Crystal
Ball, for example, abstracts the complexity of Monte Carlo simulation through a wizard-style approach to
building models in a familiar Excel environment. A simple learning curve and a modest amount of training
allows the user to focus on the business requirement, and not the complexity, of the statistics involved.
Quantrix Modeler also provides a user-friendly interface and structure for model development that more
than compensates for its limited statistical functionality. As a financial modeling tool, Modeler clearly is in-
tended as an alternative to spreadsheets for executives, analysts and power users. As most executives are
familiar with Excel, given the right level of expertise, they should be capable of developing simple predictive
models with its standard functionality.
23
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Data integration
Predictive analytics applications will invariably draw data from a variety of operational systems such as lease
administration systems, finance systems, data warehouses, credit reference sources, and spreadsheets.
For this reason, the ability to extract and integrate data from relational databases and other standard data
formats is a key requirement for model developers and analysts using these tools.
Figure 8shows the software solutions’ ability to extract data from relational databases, such as Oracle, Mi-
crosoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2; spreadsheets such as Excel; and fixed-format text files in CSV and TXT
formats. The applications’ ability to handle multiple data sources in a single model also has been assessed,
as this is a useful capability in more complex models. Possession of this capability also avoids the need to
consolidate the data beforehand in a single source.
Most of the applications are fully capable of importing data from relational databases, spreadsheets, and
text files. Solutions more limited in this respect are Oracle Crystal Ball, which effectively runs in an Excel
environment, and R. In its open-source version, R only can import data from text files, which is a significant
limitation, while JMP Pro Excel will import data from relational databases, but requires the ODBC drivers
provided by the database vendors.
A number of applications support a range of data transformation capabilities. While not strictly necessary
for predictive model development, they are useful when large datasets have to be manipulated, if data from
multiple sources needs to be merged or normalized, or where datasets are incomplete. The assessed func-
tionality includes:
• Availability of rules for data validation
• Ability to impute missing values (important where data is incomplete)
• Data selection, sampling, sorting, and merging
• Data restructuring, partitioning, and transposition
Overall, greater levels of data extract and transformation functionality are found in the enterprise business
intelligence suites, primarily SAS, SPSS Modeler, SQL Server, and WebFOCUS, which is not unexpected
as these applications are designed to run against operational systems and data warehouses. Of the stand-
alone predictive-analytics applications, KnowledgeSTUDIO, JMP Pro, and Statistica offer the most func-
tionality in this area, while general purpose tools like Excel provide the least.
Reporting and presentation
The output from predictive analytics applications are used in various ways, as indicated in Figure 9. It is
likely, however, that forecasts, data visualizations, scorecards, etc., will need to be reported and exported
to external applications such as Excel or published on Web or mobile platforms.
All the solutions reviewed provide some form of user reporting, whether it is basic output in applications
like Excel, or the more complex reporting capabilities in the business intelligence suites. With the exception
of R, all the applications also can export data to Excel, although WebFOCUS requires the optional “Quick-
data” module to deliver this functionality. Publishing to other platforms is less widely supported, however,
as only SQL Server and Microstrategy can publish to Web, PDF/Word, and mobile platforms, although
SQL Server requires “Reporting Services” to do so.
24
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Process support
All the solutions are capable of supporting ad hoc investigations in response to specific business issues
and questions. However, the output from predictive models is not necessarily used in one-off decisions,
but can be applied to operational aspects of the leasing business. Examples include risk-based pricing,
using dynamic scorecards, and upsell/cross-sell marketing, using real-time customer relationship manage-
ment data.
In these cases, the predictive analytics models must be embedded in the organization’s operational
processes and run automatically as part of a workflow. In order to do so, the application on which the model
runs must support real-time analytics or be capable of exporting the model in a format that can be used by
another application running as part of the operational process. The process support capabilities of the re-
viewed software tools are shown in Figure 10.

A number of the applications reviewed support automated real-time analytics, including SPSS Modeler,
WebFOCUS, KnowledgeSTUDIO, and Statistica. Predictive Modeling Markup Language (PMML) is an
open standard for predictive analytics that enables models developed in one application to be read and
run by another, thereby allowing models to be ported between systems with different software solutions. A
number of the applications evaluated support the reading and exporting of models in PMML.

Implementation
How predictive analytics solutions are deployed will depend on the business requirements of the equipment
finance organization. For largely ad-hoc analyses, or those involving a single or small number of analysts,
deployment on single user PCs is likely to be the most common means of implementation. With big work-
groups, such as in large risk management and compliance functions, or where the application is shared be-
tween several groups of users, a server-based deployment will be more suitable. Server installations also
will be required where real-time predictive analytics are implemented.
All the applications can be implemented as single user installations on PCs. Most also can be deployed in
a server environment, although BusinessObjects, Crystal Ball, and KnowledgeSTUDIO do not support this
option. The Professional Plus version of Quantrix Modeler is required for server deployment. The deployment
options and operating platforms of the reviewed software tools are shown in Figure 11.

For organizations not desiring in-house applications or wishing to share models securely over the Internet,
there is the option of Software as a Service (“SaaS”) solutions. Most SaaS providers offer a subscription
model, which avoids large up-front license costs. The only predictive analytics solutions not available as
SaaS options are BusinessObjects, Crystal Ball, SPSS Modeler, and Statistica.
From an operating platform perspective, all the applications evaluated are available on the later Microsoft
Windows versions with a number supporting Windows Server as well. Linux versions are available for SAS,
SPSS Modeler and WebFOCUS, as well as Microstrategy, R and Statistica. The Linux platform is more
likely to be adopted for server deployments, although R also can be run through a Linux desktop client such
as Ubuntu.
Mac users, by comparison, have very little choice with predictive analytics applications, although using a
virtual machine running Windows OS to access this functionality might be a solution. None of the enterprise
business intelligence suites support the MacOS platform for their predictive analytics modules, nor do most
of the standalone predictive analytics applications. Only Quantrix Modeler, R, and Excel are available on
Mac.
Entry costs, training and support
Software costs typically vary by the number of users, type of deployment (PC versus server), type of license
(annual versus perpetual), and the functionality provided when applications are sold as a series of modules.
Prices also are subject to negotiation, particularly for large corporate purchasers that may already be using
major software vendors’ platforms.
Licensing fee structures vary between software vendors, rendering a pricing comparison problematic. One
common model is based on an initial, up-front license fee, followed by an annual renewal fee that covers
ongoing support, upgrades, and bug fixes.
Some vendors, including IBM, offer the options of licensing by named or concurrent users. While the latter
provides more flexibility, it is more expensive on a one-off basis. Perpetual or annual license fees represent
additional payment options, although users of perpetual licenses have to purchase a support-and-upgrade

contract separately. Annual licenses bundle the support-and-upgrade contract for the 12-month period.
SaaS pricing typically is priced on a monthly or annual per user basis.
Despite the differences in pricing structures, pricing is broadly related to functionality provided. The enter-
prise business intelligence suites tend to command premium prices, as they offer a wide range of function-
ality and generally are aimed at multi-user deployments with pricing structured for larger numbers of users.
Concurrent, as opposed to named, user-license pricing also is available for each of these options at a some-
what higher cost.
Full functionality analytics solutions, such as KnowledgeSTUDIO and Statistica, are positioned between
SAS Enterprise Miner, SPSS Modeler, and SQL Server from a cost perspective, with annual maintenance
fees at 20% of the initial license cost. Statsoft, interestingly enough, also offers a leasing option that com-
prises 40% of the initial license cost over three years, and includes annual maintenance and support.
Point solutions such as Crystal Ball are less costly, as they offer a much more limited range of functionality,
while R is free in its native form. Microsoft Excel invariably will be covered by most companies’ corporate
Microsoft licenses. All of the software providers covered in this review offer training and support for their
solutions with the exception of R, which is an open-source application.
Choosing the right software solution is a critical element in successfully implementing predictive analytics.
But as in all aspects of adopting predictive analytics, a formal, structured evaluation process with full in-
volvement from all stakeholders, business and technical, as well as C-level sponsorship, is required for ben-
efits to be properly realized.

Survey of Industry Practices
Predictive analytics can be studied extensively, and its many applications and benefits extolled, yet its impact
will be minimal unless it actually is used. Key elements of this study, therefore, include perspectives on the
current and prospective role of predictive analytics in the equipment leasing and finance industry, and how
companies are using it to make meaningful business decisions.
Corollary aspects include not only how predictive analytics is utilized, and the tools being used, but also
the willingness of equipment leasing and finance companies to incorporate predictive analytics into their
decision making. To this end, a survey of selected ELFA members was conducted as to various aspects of
how the industry views and uses predictive analytics.
Methodology
The criteria used to select the survey participants included company size, the market segment, and company
type4in order to achieve a representation of companies ranging from larger, more resource rich participants
to smaller ones. The mix between surveyed companies, based on net assets and industry designation, is
shown in Figure 12.
Figure 12

Alta selected, with Foundation input, the companies to be interviewed, and designed and constructed a
survey to determine the targets’ perception and utilization of predictive analytics. Questions to identify
trends, practices, adoption rates, new areas of implementation, and perceived business benefits of predictive
analytics also were included. The questions used in the survey are attached as Appendix Two.
In-depth interviews, were conducted with senior level decision-makers and users of data within the targeted
companies. These interviews were completed in person, by telephone, as it was felt that live interviews
would yield more insights into company practices than the use of online survey technologies or formal
written responses.
During these interviews the extent of the survey targets’ use of predictive analytics, available tools, and their
integration with enterprise software was examined. How the companies approached the use of predictive
analytics within the various areas of the company was surveyed as well.
4Alta has retained the traditional company type designation (captive, independent, etc.) of the survey participants although some nonbank
entities now are under the control of bank holding companies.
29
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Responses
All companies interviewed indicated that they currently use predictive analytics to one degree or another,
although not many had programs beyond credit decisioning. The larger players use analytics in more areas
and with greater sophistication than the smaller companies. In many cases, this greater usage is a function
of regulatory requirements and the leveraging of parent company capabilities.

of this aspect of predictive analytics in the equipment finance
industry.
Benefits
All respondents to the survey consider the use of predictive analytics to be a competitive advantage due to
the benefits it provides, as listed in Figure 13, among others. Cost reduction and efficiency were the ben-
efits mentioned most often during the surveys. For instance, one respondent stated that “The increasing
regulatory requirements mean that you must squeeze every cent of profit out of operations. Predictive an-
alytics allows us to do that.”
Utilization
The predictive analytics efforts of the survey respondents are best described as ad hoc, in that predictive
analytics usage either is sporadic throughout the company or mostly focused in one area. Predictive ana-
lytics is formalized to a much greater degree in the credit risk function, where several companies have spe-
cific departments working on the predictive analytics aspects of credit, including adjudication and
delinquency management.
Given this information, it is not surprising that the chief risk officer or chief credit officer generally has ultimate
responsibility for the predictive analytics program amongst those surveyed. The credit element of the re-
spondents’ predictive analytics, consequently, is formalized and, in most cases, fairly robust. This is not the
case with other aspects of predictive analytics, as all the respondents’ efforts were deemed to be middling
to nascent in terms of potential utilization.
None of the respondents described their overall predictive analytic activities as robust, with several cate-
gorizing these efforts as being nascent. These comments referred to the state of their current efforts, and
not the level of predictive analytics adoption within the company. In this respect, banks are more likely to
have more formalized and robust activities due to regulatory requirements and Basel III concerns.

The most commonly-used end user tool amongst respondents, by far, is Microsoft Excel. While readily avail-
able and easily used, respondents pointed out several negative aspects of using Excel to perform predictive
analytics. Some of these negative aspects included the burden of data consolidation among applications
and the internal control issues surrounding Excel.
Figure 14lists which of the analytical tools reviewed in the Study are being used by the survey respondents.
As can be seen, predictive analytical software tools rarely are utilized outside of the credit function. Very
few respondents used enterprise-scale analytic platforms and only one of the companies with an ERP in-
tegrated its predictive analytics capabilities with that enterprise system.

Future trends
All but one of the survey respondents expect their company’s use of predictive analysis to increase in the
coming year. Even so, only two respondents intend to commit additional personnel to predictive analytics
in the near future. One of these respondents plans on doing so because of regulatory necessity, while the
other one expects to expand its capabilities. The remaining respondents plan to leverage already existing
capabilities and personnel, in essence, doing more with the same resources.
Is this response the result of penny pinching, underutilization of existing resources, or a need to leverage
scarce skill sets? Leveraging existing capabilities does make sense, since one of the primary benefits of
predictive analytics is efficiency and cost reduction. As one interviewee put it, “One of the major reasons
for using predictive analytics is to become more efficient, so why would we want to add costs to do it?”
These responses indicate that predictive analytics requires more structure and formalization in order to
leverage its benefits.
32
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
A key element of the survey was on general comments and trends. Comments included the need for cultural
change and how, even with predictive analytics, some executives still ‘trust their gut’ on certain decisions
rather than accepting the results of the predictive analytics. Unfortunately, there were no studies, or even
anecdotal evidence, as to the ultimate efficacy of experiential versus predictive analytic decision making.
Several respondents provided comments about the chal-
“…other than in credit
lenges of implementing predictive analytics in their com-
pany, generally to the effect that it is one thing to have
adjudication, predictive
access to the data and the tools to manipulate it, but it
takes people to do it. Several noted that another chal-
analytic remains a largely
lenge is to make certain that the information is timely and
up to date. “You can’t just look at the numbers or losses
untouched area…” and think you are okay. It needs constant attention and
updated analysis to be effective.”
Others commented that the real challenge is not getting the information or the tools to perform the analyses.
It is, instead, overcoming company culture and executive insistence and/or focus on the role of experience
in decision making. In other words, “I know what the analytics are telling me, but my experience is telling
me something else.” The general feeling among the respondents was that not only will changing company
culture be difficult, but that many of them were not necessarily even ready to start that change.
The primary conclusion to be drawn from the survey results is that, other than in credit adjudication, predic-
tive analytics remains a largely untouched area of equipment leasing and finance activities.

Illustrative Scenarios
This section of the study highlights and demonstrates the practical application of the elements presented
so far through real world scenarios of predictive analytics processes, data utilization, risk identification, and
application. The purpose of these examples, in combination with the research aspects of the study, is to
deliver practical guidance to those considering a predictive analytics implementation. The scenarios consist
of:
• Credit scoring with analytics
• Increasing residual profits
• Improving future financial performance
Scenario One – Credit scoring with analytics
Credit scoring represents one application of predictive analytics in risk management. The statistical evalu-
ation of the credit scores is another way of using predictive analytics in the credit domain. This evaluation
can be used to improve the finance company’s credit adjudication process, and, hence, profitability, through
an anticipated reduction in credit losses and write-offs. While reducing losses certainly is high on the list
of benefits, the benefits of more accurate decisioning also are well worth the effort.
It is possible, using predictive analytics, to approve more transactions with the same dollar amount of losses
(and even more still with the losses as a percent of the originations rate). The type of information created
through predictive analytics also helps support fact-based pricing and structuring. For instance, it may be
unprofitable to lend to a certain tier of applicants on standard terms; however, with a greater down payment
or extra collateral to reduce the Loss Given Default (“LGD”), taking on customers like this can be made
profitable.
This scenario illustrates how predictive analytics can be used to compare the predictive lift of one credit
score versus another, followed by a discussion of close rate data, LGD rates, and the total economic impact
of various cut-off and decisioning strategies. The scenario concludes with the pros and cons of score-
based decisioning guidelines versus actual instantaneous auto-decisioning, along with auto-approving and
auto-declining issues.
The predictive lift of credit scores
The most fundamental concept in credit score evaluation is referred to as retro analysis. In retro analysis,
the decision-maker calculates a borrower’s score at some prior point in time, using only information that
was available at that time. An analysis is made to see whether the borrower’s transaction subsequently
performed well (a “good”) or not (a “bad”), based on some fixed, relevant definition, such as whether the
transaction was ever 91 days past due.
Transactions with similar scores at origination are then grouped together into score ranges (e.g., 680-689)
and, for each range, the percentage of transactions that went bad is calculated. Low scoring ranges should
show higher bad rates (almost all scores are calibrated so that higher is better, although there are a small
number that work the other way).
34
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The fundamental concept of this exercise is that the past repeats itself, and that the best measure of what
one can expect in the future from a score is what it did in the past. The retro analysis is a virtual historical
usage, although if the score was being used in the past, the actual score values obtained at that time can
be used for this analysis. Figure 15illustrates the results of the retro analysis used to assess the scoring
parameters in this scenario.

Once the retro analysis is completed, the predictive value of the scores being analyzed should be deter-
mined. Consider, for instance, two different scores, Score A and Score B. Each score is evaluated on a
retro basis, as described above, on a portfolio of 100 transactions that had a 10% bad rate. The “predic-
tiveness” of each score is summarized in Figure 16.
Although both scores seem to work, Score A appears to work better. In the case of Score A, there are
seven bads identified in the bottom 20% of the scored population (those scoring 600 or 610), fully 70%
of all the bads in the portfolio. Score B, however, only identifies four bads in the bottom 20% of the popu-
lation, only 40% of all the bads in the portfolio. Note that this still is better than random selection, which,
with 20% of the population, would only identify 20% of the bads.

The differences illustrated in Figure 16 can be seen more easily using a Lorenz Curve (also known as a
Power Curve), as illustrated in Figure 17. The X-axis of the Lorenz Curve represents all transactions, with
the lowest scoring ones at the left, and the highest scoring transactions at the right. The Y-axis is the total
cumulative portion of bads identified by the score for a given cumulative portion of all the transactions.5
Figure 16
Score Predictiveness
The Lorenz Curve for a perfect score would start at the lower left-hand corner, and go almost straight up,
reaching the 100% bad capture level with the bottom 10% of the population, and the line would then con-
tinue horizontally to the upper right hand corner. As can be seen, the curve for Score A is always closer to
the ideal than the curve for Score B, indicating that Score A is a better performing score throughout the
credit quality spectrum.
Another approach to assessing score performance is to focus on how far a score’s curve is above the ran-
dom diagonal; that is, towards the upper, left-hand corner. The most commonly used metrics in this regard
include:
• Accuracy ratio – The area between the score’s Lorenz Curve and the random diagonal, divided by the
area between a perfect score and the random diagonal. The Accuracy Ratio, or AR, ranges from a high
of 100% to a low of 0%, although technically, if a score were worse than random, the AR would be neg-
ative.
• ROC statistic– Quite similar to the AR, except that it is based on an ROC Curve in which the X-axis, in-
stead of being all transactions, represents only the good transactions. A comparison between the ROC
Curve and the Lorenz Curve is contained in Figure 18.
While these curves are something on the order of 90% the same, it means that the curve of the perfect
score on the ROC Curve goes vertically up from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner,
so there is no need for division as there is in the AR. Rather, the ROC Statistic is simply the area below
the curve, with 1.000 being perfection, and 0.500 being random (it is usually quoted as a decimal with
the digits). The ROC Statistic is illustrated in Figure 19.
5Note that the conventions of left versus right and up versus down referenced here are consistently used in the United States, but are some-
times done the other way in other countries.

• K-S Statistic (Kolmogorov–Smirnov Statistic)– Based on the ROC Curve, the K-S Statistic is the max-
imum vertical distance between the score’s curve and the random diagonal. Perfect would be 100, and
random is zero, although, technically, it is between zero and one, but the decimal point usually is omitted.
The K-S Statistic is illustrated in Figure 20.
In general, these statistics are usually between a half and a quarter of the way above random toward per-
fection. For an ROC, 0.750 is half the way to perfect and 0.625 is a quarter of the way. The very strongest
scores will be above half way, but not by much, and some scores in use will be below a quarter of perfection,
but not by much. There is no absolute benchmark for what is a good predictiveness level, because many
factors affect what is possible, such as quantities and types of data used, the nature of the transactions
being scored, etc.

Evaluating the economic impact of credit scores
One of the questions oftentimes asked of the credit function by management is the impact of new business
of ‘moving the lever’ on the credit score. The classic method for evaluating the impact of doing so is Swap
Set Analysis. This analysis assesses the impact of ‘swapping’ credit approvals, i.e., approving some trans-
actions that were previously declined, and declining others that were previously approved.
The first step is to examine the current decisioning practice by score tier of the score being evaluated,
listing the number of applications, the current approval rate, the close rate, and, based on a Retro Analysis,
the bad/default rate for that score tier. This information is combined with the average transaction amount
and estimated LGD and then multiplied, resulting in estimated losses for each score tier. Estimated losses
are then totaled for all score tiers, as are origination volumes. This process, for the company’s current de-
cisioning process, is illustrated in Figure 21.
The next step is to swap out approvals in the low scoring tiers that have high default rates for more approvals
in the high scoring tiers with low default rates. When evaluating the impact of the score there is no reason
to approve any transactions with high default rates when there are additional lower default rate transactions
that can be approved.
The most logical initial step of this analysis is originations-neutral, keeping origination levels where they are
but seeing how much benefit can be had through more accurate decisioning. The ideal, of course, would
be to approve all good transactions and none of the bad.
38
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Figure 19
ROC Statistic
In the example inFigure 22, all transactions scoring 660 and above are approved, all transactions scoring
639 and below are declined, and a portion (23%) of those scoring 640-659 are approved. Total origination
volume is unchanged from the steady state example in Figure 22, at $480 million annually, but expected
losses are reduced from $4.8 million to $3.7 million, representing not only a 23.5% reduction in losses, but
also a net bottom line savings of $1.1 million.
It often is said in the lending world that it takes ten or twenty good deals to make up for one bad one. If so,
why would a finance company approve transactions in score tiers with 20-50% default rates, particularly
since not approving these deals materially improves profitability? Using assumptions for profit margin
(spread over cost of funds, less operating expenses) and term, it is possible to analyze the impact of such
a change in credit decisioning. As shown inFigure 23, this change results in a 7.8% improvement in overall
profit over the life of one year’s worth of transactions.
Identifying a predictive credit score that leads to more accurate decisioning makes it possible to approve
more transactions and still maintain the same dollar amount of losses (and even more still with losses as a
percent of originations rate). Additional analysis, as inFigure 24, shows that approving essentially all ap-
plications scoring 640-659 not only maintains the estimated loss amount from the current practice scenario
($4.8 million) but also results in $29 million more in originations, which is a 6% increase.
39

K-S Statistic
This scenario is slightly more profitable than the originations-neutral, loss reduction scenario, but the two
are close enough that changes in some of the assumptions, particularly margin, could change which course
is the most desirable one to be taken. As has been previously noted, this type of information also can be
used to support fact-based pricing and structuring.
Implementation nuts-and-bolts
Predictive scores can be a great benefit, when used in a purely informational mode, to help a credit manager
make a subjective decision. They also can be quite beneficial when used in conjunction with subjective de-
cisioning. For example, credit policies may be adopted precluding someone with credit authority from ap-
proving deals scoring below a certain level (or declining deals scoring above a certain level) without having
another credit person concur. In such use, the score becomes a virtual second opinion.
Scores have an even greater impact, however, when used for auto-decisioning as costs and time are re-
moved from the process, which is one of the benefits of predictive analytics. Auto-decisioning can be in
the form of auto-approval, auto-decline, or both. As a rule, banks are more likely to auto-decline, captives
to auto-approve, and independent finance companies to do both, in each case reflecting their transaction
economics, although there are lenders of all types taking each of these approaches.

Before any auto-decisioning occurs, the system is run in parallel, and many people review what the prospec-
tive outcomes would be if the system were live (reviewing not just the credit decision, but the transaction,
the precise entity approved, etc.). In practice, auto-decisioning always begins with a small portion of appli-
cations.
Letting the first group of deals proceed automatically, no matter how small, always is the most difficult –
somewhat akin to a Normandy Beach situation. From there, however, it tends to grow rather quickly, as it
becomes clear that the deals being approved or declined really should be. The positive feedback from the
market and the sales team regarding 60-second decisions further supports the initiative.
There comes a point of diminishing returns, however, when a substantial portion or, perhaps, even the ma-
jority of transactions are auto-decisioned. The rate of increase slows, therefore, as borderline deals and
unusual/special circumstances do exist. Consequently, almost no lender, at least in the commercial term
lending market, gets very close to 100% auto-decisioning today.

In addition to applications scoring in the grey/borderline area, there also are applications that trigger review
rules. Any auto-decisioning environment should include rules that prevent auto-decisioning in cases in
which:
• There is insufficient data
• Unusual events have occurred, or unusual terms are being requested
• Negative events have occurred that, in all likelihood, would result in a very low score and no auto-approval,
(e.g., a bankruptcy). While probably not necessary, these do no harm, and remove any question as to
whether such auto-decisions could ever occur.
It always is easier to begin auto-decisioning with smaller transactions than with larger ones, so most lenders
start small and move up over time. While some lenders focus on transaction amount, most focus on expo-
sure amount with, perhaps, an add-on type rule allowing for a very small additional amount for a large expo-
sure.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The rationale to initiate auto-decisioning with small transactions is that the cost savings in this market are
important and that there simply is more at risk with a larger transaction. Part of the issue also is whether
one believes that scores can make better credit decisions than people, or perhaps more to the point, than
the average credit person. Retro and Swap Set Analysis show that, at least in some markets, scores, on
average, and when properly managed, do a better job.
That said, the easiest, and probably most effective method of deciding up to what amount to auto-decision,
is to review the institution’s recent decisions. This can be done by looking at approvals versus declines on
a graph with the credit score on one axis and exposure size on the other. The data then is reviewed for pat-
terns, e.g., below what dollar level and above what score cut-off are the company’s recent decisions con-
sistently approvals? If there is a pattern, but with a few exceptions, those specific deals are reviewed as to
why they were declined, and whether, perhaps, they should have been approved.
Similarly, is there a score level below which the institution consistently declines? If there is a score cut-off
below which it would be consistent to auto-decline a small application, that cut-off should at least be con-
sidered if the low scoring applicant applies for a large transaction. After all, if giving the applicant a small
amount is out of the question, why seriously consider giving it a large amount?
Since the economic environment affects loan performance, credit managers do their best to factor the econ-
omy into their decisions when subjectively decisioning deals. Credit scoring faces the same issue. Essen-
tially, all credit scores do is provide a relative measure of risk. A 700 transaction has a lower risk than a
650, but it is not clear what that means in terms of expected default rate. Some lenders look at historical,
through-the-cycle default rates associated with specific score tiers, and assume they apply across the
board.
This can be dangerous, as the default odds for any given score tier shift over the course of the economic
cycle. During the most recent recession, for example, almost every score continued to rank-order risk, as
it was built to do (700s defaulted at a lower rate than 650s). The absolute magnitude of the default rates
increased for all score tiers, however, resulting in higher losses than some lenders expected. Figure 25,
showing 18-month default rates by year of origination, is a typical example of what occurs over the course
of an economic cycle.
In order to maintain a constant default rate cut-off, therefore, a lender needs to adjust score cut-offs as the
economy changes. Rather than simply producing a score, some newer predictive scoring models are being
designed to include macroeconomic factors and to predict a specific probability of default (e.g., 4.5%)
based on the borrower’s credit quality and the economy. While such models are more useful, and do not
require on-going cut-off adjustments, they are significantly more difficult to build, and require much more
data.
In summary, predictive analytics can be used to both develop a credit score and evaluate the performance
parameters of such a score. In this way, the company is able to use predictive analytics not only to reduce
the costs associated with manual credit adjudication but also to increase profitability through analyzing the
results of those credit decisions.

Scenario Two – Increasing residual profits
Risk management is one of the categories in which companies are applying predictive analytics today. This
area includes asset management, as most lessors consider it an aspect of risk management, since properly
managing residual risk increases residual profits. For a lessor to effectively manage residual risk using pre-
dictive analytics, however, the causative risk factors associated with the residual value must be identified
and considered in the predictive analytics process.
The approach taken in this scenario, therefore, focuses on properly defining the risks and factors that affect
residuals so that the predictive analytics program may be effectively designed and deployed. The goal of
doing so is to help companies migrate to a better risk model capable of leveraging the benefits of predictive
analytics.
Current process
A common practice in the 1980s was for an asset manager to seek input on the residual value from several
sources in the industry or commission a formal appraisal, if dictated by policy. These values were then av-
eraged, and, most likely, a haircut applied to that average to create a residual forecast matrix that was used
for pricing and risk analysis. Not much has changed 30 years later, except now this information is stored
electronically rather than in a file room.

The problem with this approach is that it is static, relies heavily on historical data, particularly comparative
sales, and focuses on make, model, and asset category reporting. From a broader perspective, this ap-
proach has tended to commoditize the leasing product as companies prefer to vacate the space rather than
develop analytics to better correlate asset values to the true risk factors that drive them.
There is a dearth of standardized guidelines, systems, and processes in residual management. Credit un-
derwriting, by comparison, has such standards and is supported and monitored by various agencies. The
tax, accounting, and legal functions also have numerous guidelines, systems, and processes specific to
them, as can be seen in Figure 26, even though there is very little economic risk associated with these
functions. Contrarily, there are few systematic processes for valuing assets.
Figure 26 !
Risk Relative to Systematic Processes
One reason the risk factors of an asset may not be addressed is the organizational structure of the asset
management function. For instance, some risk/valuation departments align by specialty. Although these
analysts have detailed knowledge of the latest avionics, powertrain, diagnostics, technology, etc., this ap-
proach sometimes creates potential roadblocks to proper risk analysis.
Such analysts may view their industry or asset as unique, rather than recognizing the similarities of general
risk factors across assets and industries. The result is that the value of the data for the identified risk vari-
ables is ignored or not leveraged. Analysts with multiple industry responsibilities have the ability to see
how the risk drivers play across different assets, thereby raising their view of risk to a portfolio level.
Another challenge of assessing the residual risk in transactions is the need to support new volume and pro-
vide analytics in a condensed time frame. Past ELFA Surveys of Equipment Finance Activity show that turn-
around times on transactions have been dropping over the last six to seven years.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
As the pressures for a fast turnaround increase, deals may become backlogged or the analysis hurried,
which in a non-systematic environment, compounds the risk. It also carries over into the portfolio, where it
is further exacerbated by the inability to make remedial changes to the asset once it is on the books. This
is another area in which residual management differs from other functions, as shown in Figure 27.

For example, if a mistake is made in assigning the depreciable life of an asset for tax purposes, it can be
remedied during the term of the lease. Even adverse credit events can be addressed prior to end of term
with restructures or additional collateral. There are very few viable options to correct a residual during the
term due to a faulty analysis, however. Figure 28 illustrates some additional items, whether they are sys-
tematic or manual processes, and their risk attributes.
A final factor relates to the fact that the equipment leasing and finance industry currently tends to focus
more on the ‘number,’ as opposed to the actual risk factors that drive that number. The lack of ability to
properly classify and identify the appropriate risk factors has led to losses in asset values in vehicles such
as SUVs, Class 8 tractors, aircraft, and construction equipment, to name but a few.
When asset losses increase, new policies are added to assure management that this will not happen again.
Since these policies do not deal with the underlying risk and value drivers, however, they can create unin-
tended consequences such as increased conservatism or the over-structuring of deals, potentially reducing
the chances of winning new business.
A proposed approach
Thus far, several factors that impede proper risk management in the residual management space have been
discussed. Given these impediments, the question becomes one of how to establish a foundation for uti-
lizing predictive analytics in residual management that identifies relevant risk attributes and assigns them to
various asset categories.
It is helpful to begin the discussion of how to classify asset and residual risk with an examination of the el-
ements of risk, in general. One approach is to examine risk from an audit perspective. There are four types
of risk in an audit environment:
• Inherent risk– the risk that the identified event will occur
• Control risk – the risk that the proper controls and processes are not in place to prevent the identified
event from occurring
• Detection risk– the risk that the controls in place do not prevent the identified event from occurring
• Audit risk– the risk that the identified event is not detected upon audit

The equipment leasing and finance company can reduce the control and detection risk levels by implement-
ing a more systematic and robust governance process for classifying and identifying asset risk. Reducing
the inherent risk in asset and residual management is more challenging. One approach is to identify, cate-
gorize, and index the proper risk factors and variables associated with the assets.
Guidance and policy, much of which has the force of law, exists to help reduce inherent risk in other equip-
ment-finance functions. This guidance includes FASB Topics and Standards Updates, government statutes,
IRS regulations, the Uniform Commercial Code, and so on. Although not as well-recognized and seldom
incorporated into residual risk management practices, similar guidance also exists for the appraisal and val-
uation of assets.
The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”) are the generally accepted standards
for professional appraisal practice in North America. USPAP contains standards for all types of appraisal
services, including real estate, personal property, business, and mass appraisal. The Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 recognizes USPAP and requires that appraisers comply
with it in federally-related transactions.
State appraiser certification and licensing boards, federal, state, and local agencies, appraisal services,
and appraisal trade associations all require compliance with USPAP. The American Society of Appraisers
(“ASA”) also aligns with USPAP and provides classes and certification.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The notion that depreciation affects asset value is fairly widely accepted. Depreciation also represents the
risk in the leased or financed asset. There are three types of depreciation recognized by USPAP, the ASA,
appraisers and the courts. These are physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obso-
lescence. The following are the accepted definitions of these terms:
• Physical deterioration– the loss in value or usefulness of a property due to the using up or expiration of
its useful life caused by wear and tear, deterioration, exposure to various elements, physical stresses, and
similar factors
• Functional obsolescence– the loss in value or usefulness of a property caused by inefficiencies or inad-
equacies of the property itself, when compared to more efficient or less costly replacement property
• Economic obsolescence (or external obsolescence)– the loss of value of a property by factors external
to the property. These may include such things as the economics of the industry, availability of financing,
loss of material and/or labor sources, passage of new legislation or ordinances, increased cost of raw
materials, labor, or utilities (without an offsetting increase in product price), reduced demand for the prod-
uct, increased competition, inflation, or high interest rates.
These three areas of risk probably have less than twenty analytical variables associated with them. This
combination, however, would create at least 80 potential scenarios to analyze when assessing the asset
risk or in setting a residual. The current residual management process does not have the foundation to per-
form predictive analytics because historical data is not categorized or indexed by these risk factors and
variables. The same holds true for institutionalized personal experience and other asset knowledge.
Properly identifying the risk factors and variables associated with an asset is vital to providing a predictive
analytics foundation. As an example, consider the distressed commercial property loan portfolio of a
medium-sized bank. The bank regulators were questioning why the equipment lease portfolio was not sub-
ject to the same economic risks as the commercial property (and, therefore, the same large write-down).
The auditors, with good reason, were skeptical of the bank’s underwriting/risk practices and, by association,
its leasing company.
The portfolio manager explained to the auditors that the valuation/appraisal methodology being used simply
looked at what similar property was trading for at the time. Other risk factors affecting value, such as supply
and demand, were not incorporated into the valuation. The appraisal did not have a baseline to validate the
supply/demand balance. The portfolio manager then illustrated this point through the example in Figure 29.
Figure 29

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
In this real estate example, the unoccupied square footage available was 1,000,000 square feet. Assuming
an occupancy rate of 100 square feet per person, it would take 10,000 people to fill the space being ana-
lyzed. Based on the net migration of individuals into the state at the time, it would take ten years to absorb
the existing office space. The portfolio manager took a baseline across the equipment leasing portfolio to
show how the assets were not under the risk of the same potential write-down, thereby satisfying the audi-
tors.
Another similar example involves vehicles. At the time, the automobile lessors were taking large residual
losses, particularly with SUVs, and there was concern the equipment leasing industry would be viewed as
risky and painted with a similar brush. Responses to those losses varied, but most revolved around taking
more conservative residuals or shunning SUVs as an asset class, rather than addressing the underlying
risks.
These responses were interesting from a risk and analytical standpoint but not unexpected from an opera-
tional perspective. In this case, the risk managers lost sight of the real risk issues, which were the functional
and economic risk from assets with poor fuel and energy efficiency. Figure 30illustrates how the risk analy-
sis for a vehicle differs based on only one risk variable (fuel costs), as represented by miles-per-gallon
(MPG).
Mathematically, and assuming similar residual processes, vehicle Y in Figure 30does not have any greater
residual risk than vehicle Z. Although this statement is true on its face, properly identifying the risk would
have exposed the approximately three times greater residual risk associated with the fuel and energy prices
of vehicle Y. This analysis indicates that vehicle Y requires more monitoring for this economic risk attribute.
Incorporating variables such as this into the residual risk management foundation allows the company to
leverage the power of predictive analytics.
This example illustrates the potential impact of improperly focusing on assets from a manufacturer and
model perspective in lieu of the actual risk. Figure 31 is an example of how the engineering stage risk of
an asset can be classified from a functional obsolescence standpoint. If management asked the residual
risk department today for a similar portfolio report based on risk classifications such as this, it is likely they
would be disappointed.

The type of information contained in Figure 31can be combined with predictive markers based on the like-
lihood of renewing the equipment, etc., to establish remarketing strategies and comply with regulatory re-
quirements, among other things. This exercise also can be utilized to determine loss given default and
properly assign reserves for the overall portfolio.
Ideally, after the risk criteria are identified for each asset, a library of, say, 20 risk attributes, with performance
curves for each based on years of data, relevant factors, and correlation analysis can be developed. Then,
as each asset is reviewed, the analyst can identify the applicable risk factors in the asset and find the curves
that best match those risk factors.
The last example regarding risk factors relates to locomotives, or SD40-2s in particular. If the functional ob-
solescence risk of Figure 31was mapped to the portfolio these locomotives would be in the “High Collateral
Risk” area. The SD40-2 locomotive also can be used to illustrate application of the three risk factors (phys-
ical, functional, and economic) to provide a foundation for analytics going forward. A methodology using
these risk factors will be presented and then compared to the current processes for assessing asset risk.
In order to assess physical depreciation risk, the loss in the value of the asset from wear, tear, and the op-
erating environment needs to be determined. The three main wear and tear components of the SD40-2
are the engine, wheel motors, and alternator. The cost at risk for these components today is a minimum of
$100,000. By examining Figure 32, it can be seen that this amount places the physical depreciation risk
as very high. Once the physical depreciation risk is identified, its elements can be monitored properly and
mitigated by asset management.

The next risk factor considered in this example is functional obsolescence, or the loss in value inherent
within the equipment. The value and, thus, the useful life of an asset are driven by the industry and appli-
cations of the equipment within that industry. The market for locomotives, for instance, generally is in the
Class 1, regional, and short line railroads. Of those locomotives, the SD40-2, with its six axles (in lieu of
the standard four) and weight, typically only is operated in volume by Class 1 railroads.
Since the SD40-2 locomotives typically are not cascaded down in high volumes to the normal secondary
market of regionals and short lines, the SD40-2 has a niche application within one industry. It is this niche
application that gives the SD40-2 a high risk rating, as represented in Figure 32.
Another risk classification within functional obsolescence is technological change. Historically, diesel elec-
tric locomotives derived tractive power from the direct utilization of DC electricity generated and then trans-
ferred to a DC-based traction motor. Introduction of the AC traction motor changed the game, however, as
AC power provided increased pulling power, improved resistance to moisture, and reduced wheel slip.
Lower maintenance and lifecycle costs for AC motors also were achieved due to their lower level of com-
plexity. As a result, locomotives began migrating to AC power from the standard DC power. DC technology
was, from an engineering technology perspective, in the Maturity Stage (in red), as represented in Figure
34. This stage, in which there is high cost versus functionality, represents high asset risk.
The last risk area considered in this example is economic risk, or risks external to the asset, such as fuel
and energy costs. Figure 34 shows how the value will continue to decrease as SD40-2 units flood the
market and lease expirations continue to introduce the dated technology into the market, thereby com-
pounding the problem. Furthermore, since the later units coming off lease likely will have the largest cost,
the losses per unit will increase. The remaining units will be scrapped and/or salvaged for components to
support other applications.

Market Applications
How does this risk factor approach to asset valuation compare to the historical data approach? Today, the
data is gath ered and a forecast is made to project value over the term, which does not align well with the
risk approach previously outlined. For example, SD40-2s would trade in the market anywhere from
$275,000 to $325,000. Different forecasts likely would occur for projected fair market value, therefore,
based on what similar units were bringing at a like term in the market – in essence, a historical basis.
Figure 34
DC Power Functional Obsolescence
53
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
This forecast approach does not align with the risk classification process. For example, it does not recognize
the impact of physical risk impact on the historical sales data, in that the $100,000 minimum cost is not
qualified in the analytics. It also does not recognize the functional risk, as there is nominal or no sales data
to address the six axle issue, the inability to cascade large volumes down to non-Class 1 railroads, or to
show the impact of new technology (the shift from DC to AC power). Nor does the forecast approach rec-
ognize the impact of economic risk on the historical data, as historical sales data does not reflect the dis-
placed technology impact as fleets continue to be returned and further depress the market.
Using the risk factor approach, the portfolio can be classified by risk (e.g., market applications, the engi-
neering stage, or engineering model runoff) and monitored by a system based on the risk classification as-
signment. This risk classification also can be used predictively. For example, locomotives with similar
attributes (six axles and non-AC technology) likely may be subject to the same effects on their value or
useful life. Even the values or useful lives of other transportation assets with niche applications within their
industry, or assets affected by gains in energy efficiency are likely to experience impacts similar to those in
the rail industry.
The current asset management processes are not well-aligned to leverage the benefits of predictive analyt-
ics, however, as they focus on sales of similar assets, rather than the three USPAP depreciation factors.
Consequently, changes must be made to those practices and how risk is perceived if predictive analytics
are to be utilized effectively in this function. Perhaps the best advice regarding predictive analytics and
residual management is reflected in a quote by Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, to “Change before you
have to.”

Scenario Three – Improving future financial performance
Another reason to utilize predictive analytics in the equipment leasing and finance industry is to increase
profitability and financial performance. Predictive analytics can do so by providing insights into the portfo-
lio-level results of various decisions, including up-front pricing and back-end disposition practices. External
factors such as measures of national or global economic activity also can be made part of predictive analy-
sis.
This knowledge of how various factors and corporate decisions affect portfolio returns can be used to al-
locate resources or uncover hidden sources of profit (or loss). The combination of this knowledge, with
constant and immediate feedback on actual performance, then can lead to possible courses of action tar-
geting increased profitability, as measured by the applicable yields.
Practices for evaluating credit and residual risk were examined in the previous two scenarios. This scenario
will incorporate credit and asset risks into a portfolio-based measure of return in order to understand and
begin to predict the overall performance of a portfolio of equipment finance transactions. While a number
of performance measures are certainly valid for this analysis, the focus here is on Risk-adjusted Return on
Capital (RAROC), since it directly incorporates the two key variables of customer credit information and
asset quality ratings.
For an analysis to result in relevant and actionable information, it must be expressed at the portfolio level.
Yet, because the yield-producing units within a portfolio are transactions, actions must be implementable
at the loan and lease level and at key decision points over the life of the transaction. The ultimate profitability
of the portfolio depends to a great extent on how well understood and executed the firm’s policies are at
each of these decision points.
If management is to predict the performance of a portfolio of equipment leases and loans, it not only must
identify the variables that drive portfolio performance, it also must analyze how changes in those variables
affect returns. Management then must establish a link between its analysis of portfolio performance and
actual business practices such as quotation, program design, marketing emphasis, and collection practices.
This link has three major components:
• Historical– profitability analysis of completed transactions against different values for the driving variables,
and comparison to how the transactions initially were priced
• Predictive– review of expected changes to portfolio profitability as the values for the causative variables
change. These reviews may be simple what-if reviews or sophisticated stress style analyses, as both types
fall under predictive analytics
• Diagnostic– on-going measurement of actual results against expected results along with continuous val-
idation and refinement of data elements and predictive capabilities.
The derivation of actionable information starts with consistent and complete data on financial performance
at the transaction level, which is the level that ultimately drives portfolio performance and at which many of
the most important variables act. This data then must be processed and analyzed through a sufficiently so-
phisticated, transparent, and flexible portfolio performance model that provides results on a timely basis.
The predictive analysis model
While the predictive analytics model must focus on the financial performance of the individual leases and
55
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
loans that make up the portfolio, it also should allow for grouping transactions in logical units, for example,
by territory or asset type, as well as more ad hoc groupings, such as by yield or buy-out date. This flexibility
will allow predictive analysis of questions such as:
• How will yields of asset class A compare to the overall portfolio or compared to asset class B if residual
realization is changed?
• How will tightening credit standards affect performance in territory A as opposed to territory B, or as
compared to the overall portfolio?
• How will degradation of the credit quality for a class of customers affect yield and capital requirements?
The important point is not to use a model that locks the firm into a particular form of analysis. Because pre-
dictive analytics is iterative, it will have a strong tendency to suggest further questions that may not have
been anticipated at the beginning. Much of the value of a predictive model, therefore, lies in the ability to
perform intelligent ad hoc analysis with it. A good predictive model also anticipates the needs of a varied
set of users, including budgeting and forecasting, pricing, and portfolio management.
The model must accommodate real world outcomes, as many transactions do not play out in the real world
as they were originally contracted. For example, the payments due on the 20th of the month in a 60-month
transaction are unlikely to be made precisely on the 20th, or even to run the full 60 months. Events such
as buy-outs or upgrades often will make the real transaction very different from what was priced. Therefore,
a useful model will incorporate various transaction outcomes, both on the historical and predictive sides.
Many equipment finance companies adjust their pricing in order to win deals that they know, through expe-
rience, will play out more profitably than as originally priced. Good examples of this are office equipment
that has a strong track record of going month-to-month, or contracts in which the equipment is repeatedly
refreshed and the contract extended. A good analytics model should be able to express these realities in
terms of yield, so that management knows, for example, that certain lines of business return, on average,
25 more basis points than originally priced.
Good portfolio analytics also should help identify the characteristics of customers with suboptimal behaviors
such as those that always return the copier precisely when the lease expires. Pricing management then
can use this information to consider modifying the pricing policies in an attempt to limit originating these
lower-yielding deals. In all cases, it is important to express the gain or loss under these various scenarios
in terms of the yields used by pricing management.
A predictive model helps develop theories about how the portfolio will perform in the future based on
changes in underlying factors and variables, thereby suggesting actions to enhance performance. In prac-
tice, this includes such things as:
• Producing a forecast of the run off of the existing book of business, including forecasting how the various
outcomes will affect returns
• Layering on a new business forecast, again, modeling the outcomes based on historical data, and incor-
porating the impact of external factors
• Comparing actual results with predicted results and determining any differences or shortfalls
Methodology
The predictive model and methodology discussed in this section was applied to a portfolio of 67 completed
56
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
aircraft transactions supplied by an ELFA member company. In addition to removing company specific
data, customer names, and information identifying specific aircraft, credit scores were converted from the
proprietary system indicators to a simple numerical scale. The portfolio included four tax leases and 63 con-
ditional sales contracts.
The data in the subject portfolio was reasonably rich, containing actual cash flows (dates and amounts)
from the system of record, as well as information on the aircraft type, targeted returns, and buyout amounts.
In a few cases, most notably the term of the original transaction, data was incomplete. A representative
term of 84 months was used when the original term was unknown.
Before applying predictive analytics to the sample portfolio, a series of questions about the performance of
individual completed transactions, groups of completed transactions, and, ultimately, the historical portfolio
as a whole, was asked.
• What was the anticipated yield of the transaction, group, and portfolio?
• What was the actual yield on the transaction, group, and portfolio?
• What factors accounted for the differences between the priced yields and those actually realized?
• Can these factors be statistically correlated to the outcomes?
The sample portfolio of completed transactions was used to create a variety of analytic portfolios to better
understand how these completed transactions perform under certain scenarios. For example, the analyst
could determine when, and under what conditions, transactions were terminated early or renewed, and if
there were identifiable factors or variables driving those actions.
Two portfolios were assembled for analysis from the sample portfolio data. The ‘Actual’ portfolio contained
the cash flows and returns actually experienced. The ‘As Priced’ portfolio, on the other hand, represented
the assumed cash flows and returns that were in place at the time of booking the deals. Although the indi-
vidual transactions in this portfolio were large enough to warrant individual analysis, the ideas and principles
of this analysis applied to portfolios of smaller assets, as well.
A single transaction from the portfolio was used to illustrate the method of analysis. In this transaction, an
airplane was financed in July of 2003 on an 84-month conditional sales contract with a targeted, after-tax
economic ROE of 15.09%. What actually happened, however, was that the lessee exercised an early buy-
out option after only three years.
Figure 36 contains a comparison of the economic, ROE cash flows for this transaction. These include
certain portfolio-level expense assumptions, referred to as secondary expenses, which represent the cost
of carrying the transaction on the portfolio, as well as the tax savings. The actual, versus as-priced, yields
for the same transaction are compared in Figure 37.
The highlighted nominal, after-tax ROE of 15.09% is the yield that was targeted when the transaction was
priced. In this case, the actual transaction results fell well short of the targeted yield. Understanding why
it fell short, and what factors contributed to the shortfall, could help the company analyze how changes in
these factors would impact future portfolio performance.
Examination of the actual cash flows of this deal shows that the lessee paid rents almost exactly as the
transaction anticipated, and that nearly all the difference between the actual versus priced yield is the result
of an early buyout. The buyout amount at 36 months is lower than the estimated 84-month residual value
used to price the deal.
57
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
This shortfall suggests three areas for further investigation. First, was the residual value used for pricing
correctly determined? Were the physical, functional, and economic risk factors, such as future fuel prices,
properly taken into account? Second, was the early buyout quoted and executed correctly? Third, how will
future buyouts impact portfolio performance?

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Just as in the single transactions, analysis of the portfolio shows that much more cash was anticipated in
the pricing than actually was realized. Further analysis indicates that all but a few of the transactions were
terminated early, with a 33.46 month, weighted-average actual term versus a presumed 84-month priced
term. The yield comparisons of Figure 38also show that, on the whole, the actual transactions were sig-
nificantly more profitable than priced, with a nearly 50 basis point premium for the NAT MISF. The economic
ROE was a substantial 977 basis points better.
Given results such as these, one might be tempted to take the view in this case that the pricing and, more
importantly, the early buy out policies, clearly work in practice. An examination of the returns on the individual
transactions, however, shows a great deal of variation between the yields and highlights other areas requiring
additional analysis. As can be seen in Figure 39, there is wide variability in the actual ROE between trans-
actions. Even though all were priced to an ROE in the range of 6.92% to 31.82%, the realized ROE varies
from a negative 94.51% to a positive 449.31%.
Segmentation analysis
The analyst’s knowledge of the business and company practices will determine what segments to investigate
before applying predictive analytics. The following discussion seeks to illustrate this by creating a series of
ad-hoc segments and then drilling down into the transactions to discover the sources of the transaction
performance, the preliminary outcome of which is to suggest potential causative variables that affect yields.
Since transactions were priced to an economic ROE in the subject portfolio, the first segmentation per-
formed is actual performance against the targeted ROE. About half of the portfolio, or 33 transactions,
show a realized ROE greater than 0% and less than 60%. These 33 transactions have a combined portfolio
ROE of 12.43%, or 21 basis points shy of the combined ROE yield of the portfolio as it was priced.

Twelve of the remaining 34 transactions show negative ROEs, and have a combined portfolio yield of neg-
ative 3.82%. The remaining 22 transactions, those with ROEs over 60%, yielded a combined portfolio
ROE of 124.85%. These ROE bands are shown in Figure 40.
Based on this initial segmentation, the portion with unusually poor returns can be analyzed further to identify
potential predictive variables that may have affected these returns. Drilling down to view the most egre-
giously low ROE transactions within the 12 transactions with negative ROEs yielded the following informa-
tion:
• A lease of a Cessna Citation Excel that ran for 20 months was bought out at fair market value. This sug-
gests that the initial appraisal of the asset was overly optimistic, or that some event – perhaps excessive
use or unaccounted for obsolescence – rendered the fair market value of the end-of-term asset far below
expectations.
• A lease of a Cessna Citation XLS had a very poor payment history over 30 months before the asset was
liquidated. The customer credit rating was a seven on a one to ten scale (where one is best), so the poor
payment history was not a shock. This outcome suggests further investigation into both the accuracy of
the credit scoring on the transaction and the lessee acceptability criteria in order to determine whether
this was bad luck, bad pricing, or the result of a measureable variable.
Note that a similar level of analysis could be performed on segments in larger portfolios of middle or small
ticket assets. This could be done by creating segments using multiple filter criteria, such as a segment of
actual transactions with a poor ROE, poor payment history, and, yet, fair to good credit scores.
In addition to providing potential predictive data, analysis of the poor performing transactions might point
out risks for which the lessor should be compensated through more favorable pricing and structuring. It
also might suggest that transactions with certain characteristics should be avoided altogether.
Examination of high-yielding transactions, on the other hand, seeks to identify any traits that would allow
the lessor to target similar transactions, and, if necessary, determine how much more competitive the sales
team can be, given the increase in actual yields over the priced yields. An analysis of the high-yielding
transactions produced the following information:
• The highest yielding transaction was a lease of a Cessna Citation Excel that ran for 30 months and, over
that term, collected payments worth nearly twice the original value of the aircraft. In looking at this deal,
an accounting error first must be ruled out, but if the cash flows are accurate, the analyst would want to
learn more detail about this transaction.
• This lease of a Gulfstream G200 ran for only four months, after which the aircraft was purchased by the
lessee for more than the original asset cost. The analyst would want to know if this is the result of a
bridge financing program, or if the transaction was really intended to run longer. Given the high yield, and
if it was intended to run longer, the analyst should look for predictive factors or characteristics that identify
similar potential opportunities.

Figure 39
Economic ROE as Priced and Realized
Given that two of the top three most profitable transactions had very short terms, a logical question to ask
is whether short term transactions are more profitable, in general, and, if so, what predictive variables might
be driving these results? The average and weighted average terms are displayed, by ROE band, in Figure
41, as a simple first pass at assessing the effect, if any, of transaction term on ROE. Although slicing the
transaction terms this way does not seem to indicate any correlation between ROE and term, it does sug-
gest yet another avenue of investigation.
For example, further analysis indicates that both the highly profitable and unprofitable transactions tend to
run shorter than the normal transactions in the subject portfolio. While the negative ROE on shorter trans-
actions makes some sense, as deals that default or have other payment troubles typically end early, it is not
clear why very profitable transactions also tend to be shorter. This finding merely raises additional questions,
though, as no conclusions can be reached at this point about the relationship of actual term to profitability.
Two more ways that may prove valuable in identifying predictive factors include the relationship between
manufacturer and ROE (Figure 42). It is clear that ROE is not consistent across manufacturers in the
sample data, yet the distribution of transactions among the two major vendors and the others that make up
the subject portfolio is roughly comparable.

Figure 43 shows that the variation in yield assumes a clear pattern, i.e., the better the credit score, the
better the return, except in the ‘Other’ category. This could mean that better credits could be priced more
aggressively if there is more market share to be had, or, perhaps, that the company is not being fully com-
pensated for the risk inherent in the poorer credits.

When using a predictive analytics model, companies will explore a wide variety of segment views into their
data, and then delve further into those that promise to provide the most actionable and effective information.
The process of determining which views hold most promise can be guided heuristically, using the knowledge
and experience of the leasing professional, or a ‘big data’ approach may be taken, in which analysis is per-
formed on all available data with the hope of uncovering previously undiscovered relationships.
A sufficiently large and rich set of data should be collected and regression statistics between the variables
calculated. The statistical significance of the relationship between those variables then is established. The
iterative process of establishing a data set, investigating it, taking action, and measuring the results leads
to further refinement and additions to the data. This new data then is refined and added to the investigative
approach, where new and different actions are taken, and new results measured.
Outcomes modeling
Validation of predictive analytics requires creation of portfolio forecasts that then can be compared to actual
outcomes. As is evident from the preceding comparison of actual transaction performance to the original
transaction pricing, the analyst must model the real world outcomes present in any real portfolio in order to
create a meaningful portfolio forecast.
In the subject portfolio, there were no extensions or re-leases, as all but one of the transactions ended early.
Consequently, the outcome model for forecasts based on the subject portfolio need only be concerned
with early terminations. The other outcomes, which will not be discussed here, would be developed and
treated very similarly, however.
A number of collateral quality factors were set for each aircraft as part of setting up the RAROC calculations.
One such factor was value retention over the course of the lease. One method for creating an outcomes
model is to evaluate realized disposition amounts by value retention class. Figure 44plots the realized dis-
position amount, as a percentage of original asset cost, over the number of months into the transaction
when the deal was terminated, for one value retention class. The trend line represents how the value of the
asset decreases over time.
63
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
An outcomes model for the value retention of class 4 transactions can be built from this information, as il-
lustrated in Figure 45. The first column of Figure 45 shows the outcomes model broken up into seven,
12-month bands. The second shows the likelihood of termination within each 12-month band, based on
how many transactions out of the entire population of value retention class 4 transactions in the actual port-
folio did, in fact, terminate in that timeframe. The third column smoothes the termination percentage curve,
as the lumpiness in the actual data is presumed to be the result of the small number of transactions. The
last column approximates the trend line numerically.
Figure 44
Basic Analysis for Outcomes Modeling of Early Termination
Using this basic method, the analyst could construct an outcomes model for each set of transactions that
has materially different outcomes behaviors. Within the predictive analytics model, outcome models can
be applied to forecasts and runoff in two ways:
• Simple percentage method – each transaction is modeled to behave like the entire class to which the
outcomes model is applied. In this example, based on Figure 45, in month 24, 25% of each transaction
would be assumed to terminate, with a disposition amount equal to 105% of the asset cost times that
25%. In month 36, another 25% would terminate, with a disposition amount equal to 96% of the asset
cost times that 25%, and so on, until the last ten percent of the transaction runs the full term with a
residual amount of 60% of the asset cost times ten percent.
64
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The advantage of the simple percentage method is that, viewed from a portfolio level, it provides an ac-
curate representation of how the forecast runs off – every month, the fragments of deals that are termi-
nated add up to exactly the predicted attrition. However, viewed on an individual transaction basis, it
does not reflect reality. Each transaction either terminates or it does not – a series of systematic partial
terminations is not realistic.

• Stochastic method – one stochastic model, the Monte Carlo method, rolls the dice, as it were, each
month for each transaction, so that, just as in the real world, the transaction either terminates or it does
not, according to the probabilities set up in the figure. The stochastic method is used for stress testing
the data.
Outcomes models in some form are used by many equipment finance companies, often as a part of the
treasury or forecasting functions. The outcomes modeling needs of a profitability model are similar in many
respects to existing approaches, with the exception that the outcomes must be viewed at the transaction
level for optimal usefulness. There are many different ways to construct useable outcomes models, ranging
from very simple to extraordinarily complex. The above discussion is merely a sample approach used to il-
lustrate the concept.
Forecasting
Once an historical analysis has been performed, a forecast is generated that embodies whatever strategies
have been decided upon. In this example, it is assumed that new target pricing has been developed in re-
sponse to the analysis. The analyst first investigates how this forecast looks from a cash, tax, and accounting
perspective, and then performs what-if analyses to test potential scenarios. Finally, as actual data comes
in, the analyst can see how well the new policies and practices are working and, if necessary, take corrective
action immediately.
65
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Figure 46contains a simple representation of a portfolio forecast. Just as in the analysis of historical data,
forecasts also need to be represented at a transaction level. The predictive analytic model converts the
data in Figure 46 into transactions. The lessor in this example hopes to book about $500 million in new
aircraft lease business in 2013.
In addition to the basics economics represented in Figure 46, the lessor includes risk assumptions that
will be used to drive the capital allocation and expense loads used in the RAROC calculations. The risk as-
sumptions for this example include value retention, the collateral grade, and credit score and are used to
generate probability of default, LGD, and equity requirements. After creating this forecast, the analyst can
examine the cash, tax, and accounting implications.
What if, after reviewing the forecast, though, it was deemed that the credit quality was liable to deteriorate?
By creating a segment from customers with a credit score of five, the analyst could for instance, modify
those credit scores to eight. This allows the analyst to see how such credit deterioration would affect port-
folio performance, as shown in Figure 47. Note that the MISF and IRR yields are unaffected, since they
are calculated without the risk loads, but, in Figure 48, the economic ROE and the Risk ROE are seriously
compromised.

The deteriorating credit scores caused more capital to be allocated to the transactions, resulting in lower
interest costs, but they also created a large increase in secondary expenses for higher expected losses.
The net result is that the ROE yields were driven much lower. What-if analysis such as this also could en-
compass any combination of residual variation, fee income and expenses, borrowing costs, new business
volume, or changes in the yield target.
66
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
By layering the forecast onto the current working portfolio and applying the appropriate outcomes models,
the analyst creates a solid view into the financial behavior of the company’s portfolios based on potential
changes in the underlying variables. This ability to rapidly develop and test out profitability enhancement
ideas and to monitor the results of ongoing efforts for continual improvement is the essence of predictive
analytics.

Advanced analysis
The analysis of the subject portfolio so far has identified a number of areas in which further investigation is
warranted. The portfolio analysis only has scratched the surface of the kind of analysis, system design, and
data collection required to apply robust predictive analytics to large, diverse portfolios, though. Additionally,
the set of about 100,000 data points used to create the subject portfolio hardly qualifies as big data, and
an entirely different level of insight also could be gained by including external economic factors such as
GDP growth or unemployment rate in the analysis.
Nonetheless, even with these limitations, correlation analysis on the sample portfolio yields interesting re-
sults. The portfolio was subjected to a standard correlation analysis in order to produce a Pareto table
showing how the data items in the individual transactions correlate to the Risk ROE, or RAROC. This
Pareto chart for the entire portfolio, correlated to Risk ROE, is shown in Figure 49.
67
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The labels along the X-axis are the categories of data available for analysis. The goal of this exercise is to
obtain an unbiased ranking of factors that affect profitability. Figure 49 presents the results of a naive
analysis, in which no assumptions were made about what kind of relationships exist between the Risk ROE
and the underlying transaction data. The factors are listed from left to right in the order of their relative
effect on ROE.
• CUST_NAME– the highest correlation is by customer name and confirms the common knowledge that
some customer relationships are more profitable than others. What is new in this example, though, is the
ability to put hard return numbers on that common sense observation, to view how customer profitability
changes over time, and to quickly ferret out exceptional cases in which particular customers may have
transactions with wildly different yields

• EQUIP_DESC– the next most significant factor is equipment description, or type of aircraft. Grouping
the portfolio by aircraft type shows that 14 different types of aircraft are represented. These results match
what experience suggests, i.e., leases of some assets are more profitable than others, but a level of clarity
and the ability to further investigate the data has been added here.
• LEASE_TYPE – Common sense suggests this is not a meaningful result on a portfolio this small, given
that chance could easily result in the four tax leases having considerably higher or lower yields than the
average, which is what this result is saying.
Correspond ingly richer results may be obtained in a larger portfolio with better information on assets, cus-
tomers, and external economic factors. In a more varied portfolio, correlation analysis can also be done
more effectively on a segment, since it is likely that the factors driving portfolio profitability for a railcar port-
folio are different from those driving profitability on office equipment or lift trucks.
68
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS—INCREASING PROFITABILITY, MANAGING RISK, AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The last level of advanced statistical tools to be discussed is stochastic analysis, which includes Monte
Carlo simulations. Stress tests such as these are used widely in the financial world, often due to regulatory
requirements. In addition to stress testing, stochastic analysis also can be used for more active management
of portfolio performance, such as evaluating the likely outcomes from entering or exiting a line of business,
changing pricing policy, or purchasing a portfolio.
A first-pass stochastic model could test the portfolio against any variable or set of variables, such as those
that drive the credit scoring or collateral valuation models. A representative collateral valuation model was
created in the subject portfolio using factors such as aircraft size, manufacturer stability, etc., to predict
how likely the asset was to retain its value over time. Based on these inputs, a formula determined the col-
lateral quality rating, which then was used with the customer’s credit rating to determine expense loads and
capital requirements in the RAROC calculations.
Stochastic analysis achieves a new level of usefulness because it changes many variables across set ranges
according to statistical probabilities, running thousands of cases to determine the most likely outcomes.
Applying stochastic analysis, pricing management could use its collateral quality or credit rating formulas
to analyze the effect of a change in fuel prices on RAROC, for instance. By establishing an expected fuel
price (based on external economic data), pricing could then determine whether the expected RAROC is
still within the company’s expectations. A similar analysis could be used to assess the impact on profitability
of expected renewal activities, or of an economic downturn.
The value of tools such as those discussed in this scenario is that they can be used to improve future prof-
itability by assessing portfolio performance under different assumptions. They also can be used to evaluate
the impact of changing those internal or external assumptions. Gaining insight into the effect of these po-
tential outcomes allows the equipment finance company to take appropriate courses of action targeted to
addressing them.

Conclusions
Equipment leasing and finance companies can no longer compete by employing only those technologies
that gather, traditionally analyze, and store data. Progressive firms are already leveraging information to
create competitive advantage—and this trend will continue as other members of the industry feel the pain
and take steps, literally and figuratively, to get up to speed. But companies not yet using business intelli-
gence and, particularly, predictive analytics face a double challenge: They must first collect and assemble
worthwhile data. They must then determine the most effective applications for analyzing that data to produce
actionable information.
Decisions must also be made regarding how data is to be segmented, the methods by which it is to be in-
tegrated, and the applications it is to be integrated into. Additional decisions concern how the data is to be
analyzed and how it is to be used, as well as the frequency with which the data is to be updated and the
method by which currency is to be assured.
Thus it is one thing to access big data and possess tools to manipulate it. It is quite another to bridle these
assets in such a way that they produce actionable information. Doing so requires financial resources, highly
specialized expertise, and time to implement new processes. Also instrumental: the intellectual horsepower
to choose methodologies, manage process conversions, and create and nurture the cultural acceptance
necessary to support the new approach .
Companies today are deluged with data, but predictive analytics remains a component of business intelli-
gence that is largely untouched. The question industry executives must answer, then, is whether their firms
will rise to the challenge and drive higher volumes and profits by leveraging data through predictive analyt-
ics—or whether they will procrastinate and become mired in the mud of indecision.

Appendix One
– Glossary –
Accuracy Ratio
The accuracy ratio is the area between a score’s Lorenz Curve and the random diagonal, divided by the
area between a perfect score and the random diagonal. The Accuracy Ratio, or AR, ranges from a high of
100% to a low of 0%.
Business intelligence
Business intelligence is the ability of an organization to take its data, convert it into knowledge, and get the
right information to the right people, at the right time, via the right channel. If implemented effectively, busi-
ness intelligence can show not only the big picture, but the details behind the key drivers of the business.
Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, analytics, data mining, process
mining, complex event processing, business performance management, and benchmarking.
Economic obsolescence
Economic obsolescence is the loss of value of a property by factors external to the property, including such
things as the economics of the industry, availability of financing, passage of new legislation, increased cost
of raw materials, labor, or utilities (without an offsetting increase in product price), reduced demand for the
product, increased competition, inflation or high interest rates, or similar factors.
Functional obsolescence
Functional obsolescence can be thought of as the loss in value or usefulness a property caused by ineffi-
ciencies or inadequacies of the property itself, when compared to a more efficient or less costly replacement
property that new technology has developed.
K-S Statistic (Kolmogorov–Smirnov Statistic)
Based on the ROC Curve, the K-S Statistic is the maximum vertical distance between the score’s curve
and the random diagonal. Perfect would be 100, and random is zero (though technically it is between zero
and one, the decimal point is usually omitted).
Lorenz Curve
A Lorenz Curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distribution of an empirical probability distri-
bution. As a graph, it shows the proportion of the distribution assumed by the bottom y% of the values. It
is used in business modeling, such as to measure distributions such as the actual delinquency (Y%) of the
X% of customers with the worst predicted risk scores.
LGD (Loss Given Default)
LGD is the likely loss on the transaction, typically expressed as a percentage of the exposure. It is trans-
action-specific because the losses are generally understood to be a function of key transaction character-
istics such as the value of the collateral or residual.
Monte Carlo simulation
The Monte Carlo is an example of a stochastic model. When used in portfolio evaluation, multiple simulations
of the performance of the portfolio are done based on the probability distributions of the individual variable
being analyzed. A statistical analysis of the results then helps determine the probability that the portfolio
will provide the desired performance.

Pareto chart
A Pareto chart is used to graphically summarize and display the relative importance of the differences be-
tween groups of data. It contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in
descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. It can be constructed by
segmenting the range of the data into groups, segments, bins, or categories.
Physical deterioration
Physical deterioration is the loss in value or usefulness of a property due to the using up or expiration of its
useful life caused by wear and tear, deterioration, exposure to various elements, physical stresses, etc.
Predictive analytics
Predictive "analytics" is the application of statistical techniques to current and historical facts to make pre-
dictions about future events in order to enhance decision making. Predictive models exploit patterns found
in data to identify risks and opportunities and capture relationships among many factors, thereby allowing
assessment of the risk or opportunity associated with a particular set of conditions.
Retro analysis
Retro analysis is a concept in credit score evaluation in which the decision-maker calculates a borrower’s
score at some prior point in time, using only information that was available at that time. An analysis is made
to see whether the borrower’s transaction subsequently performed well or not, based on some fixed, relevant
definition, such as whether the transaction was ever 91 days past due.
ROC Statistic
ROC Statistic is quite similar to the Accuracy Ratio, except that it is based on the ROC Curve where the
x-axis, instead of being all transactions, is only the “good” transactions. The curve of the perfect score on
the ROC Curve goes vertically up from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner, so there
is no need for division as there is in the Accuracy Ratio. The ROC Statistic is the area below the curve,
with 1.000 being perfection, and 0.500 being random.
Stochastic modeling
Stochastic modeling is a method of financial modeling in which one or more variables within the model are
random. Stochastic modeling is used to estimate the probability of outcomes within a forecast to predict
what conditions might be like under different situations. The random variables are usually constrained by
historical data, such as return on past leases.

Foreword
Thisbookdealswithquantitativeeffortstopredicthumanbehavior.Oneof
the earliest efforts to do that was in World War II. Norbert Wiener, the
father of “cybernetics,” began trying to predict the behavior of German
airplane pilots in 1940—with the goal of shooting them from the sky. His
method was to take as input the trajectory of the plane from its observed
motion, consider the pilot’s most likely evasive maneuvers, and predict
wheretheplanewouldbeinthenearfuturesothatafiredshellcouldhitit.
Unfortunately, Wiener could predict only one second ahead of a plane’s
motion,but20secondsoffuturetrajectorywerenecessarytoshootdowna
plane.
In Eric Siegel’s book, however, you will learn about a large number of
prediction efforts that are much more successful. Computers have gotten a
lotfastersinceWiener’sday,andwehavealotmoredata.Asaresult,banks,
retailers, political campaigns, doctors and hospitals, andmany more organi-
zations have been quite successful of late at predicting the behavior of
particular humans. Their efforts have been helpful at winning customers,
elections, and battles with disease.
Myview—andSiegel’s,Iwouldguess—isthatthispredictiveactivityhas
generallybeengoodforhumankind.Inthecontextofhealthcare,crime,and
terrorism,itcansavelives.Inthecontextofadvertising,usingpredictionsis
more efficient and could conceivably save both trees (for direct mail and
catalogs) and the time and attention of the recipient. In politics, it seems to
reward those candidates who respect the scientific method (some might
disagree, but I see that as a positive).

xviii Foreword
However,asSiegelpointsout—earlyinthebook,whichisadmirable—
these approaches can also be used in somewhat harmful ways. “With great
power comes great responsibility,” he notes in quoting Spider-Man. The
implication is that we must be careful as a society about how we use
predictive models, or we may be restricted from using and benefiting from
them. Like other powerful technologies or disruptive human innovations,
predictiveanalyticsisessentiallyamoralandcanbeusedforgoodorevil.To
avoid theevil applications, however, it is certainly important to understand
whatispossiblewithpredictiveanalytics,andyouwillcertainlylearnthatif
you keep reading.
Thisbookisfocusedonpredictiveanalytics,whichisnottheonlytypeof
analytics,butthemostinterestingandimportanttype.Idon’tthinkweneed
morebooksanywayonpurelydescriptiveanalytics,whichonlydescribethe
pastanddon’tprovideanyinsightastowhyithappened.Ialsooftenreferin
my own writing to a third type of analytics—“prescriptive”—that tells its
users what to do through controlled experiments or optimization. Those
quantitative methods are much less popular, however, than predictive
analytics.
Thisbookandtheideasbehinditareagoodcounterpointtotheworkof
Nassim Nicholas Taleb. His books, including The Black Swan, suggest that
manyeffortsatpredictionaredoomedtofailbecauseofrandomnessandthe
inherent unpredictability of complex events. Taleb is no doubt correct that
some events are black swans that are beyond prediction, but the fact is that
most human behavior is quite regular and predictable. The many examples
that Siegel provides of successful prediction remind us that most swans are
white.
Siegel also resists the blandishments of the “big data” movement.
Certainly some of the examples he mentions fall into this category—data
that is too large or unstructured to be easily managed by conventional
relational databases. But the point of predictive analytics is not the relative
size or unruliness of your data, but what you do with it. I have found that
“big data often equals small math,” and many big data practitioners are
contentjusttousetheirdatatocreatesomeappealingvisualanalytics.That’s
not nearly as valuable as creating a predictive model.

Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the Twenty-first Century
—Title of a Harvard Business Review article by
Thomas Davenport and DJ Patil, who in 2015
became the first U.S. Chief Data Scientist
Prediction is booming. It reinvents industries and runs the world.
More and more, predictiveanalytics (PA) drives commerce, manufactur-
ing,healthcare,government,andlawenforcement.Inthesespheres,organi-
zations operate more effectively by way of predicting behavior—i.e., the
outcomeforeachindividualcustomer,employee,patient,voter,andsuspect.
Everyone’s doing it. Accenture and Forrester both report that PA’s
adoption has more than doubled in recent years. Transparency Market
Research projectsthePAmarket willreach $6.5 billionwithin afew years.
A Gartner survey ranked business intelligence and analytics as the current
number one investment priority of chief information officers. And in a
Salesforce.com study, PA showed the highest growth rate of all sales tech
trends, more than doubling its adoption in the next 18 months. High-
performance sales teams are four times more likely to already be using PA
than underperformers.

The Prediction Effect
I’m just like you. I succeed at times, and at others I fail. Some days good
things happento me, somedays bad. We always wonderhow things could
have gone differently. I begin with seven brief tales of woe:

that paid dearly—knee surgery is expensive. Could the company have

these years, my mailbox wonders why companies don’t know me
well enough to send less junk mail (and sacrifice fewer trees
needlessly).

But what do they all have in common?
These challenges—and many others like them—are best addressed with
prediction. Will the patient’s outcome from surgery be positive? Will the
credit applicant turn out to be a fraudster? Will the homeowner face a bad
mortgage? Willtheairfarego down?Willthecustomerrespondifmaileda

Prediction in Big Business—The Destiny of
Assets
There’sanotherangle.Beyondbenefitingyouandmeasconsumers,predic-
tion serves the organization, empowering it with an entirely new form of
competitive armament. Corporations positively pounce on prediction.
In the mid-1990s, an entrepreneurial scientist named Dan Steinberg
delivered predictive capabilities unto the nation’s largest bank, Chase, to
assist with their management of millions of mortgages. This mammoth
enterprise put its faith in Dan’s predictive technology, deploying it to drive

Prediction is power. Big business secures a killer competitive stronghold

in undetectable ways as you drive, shop, study, vote, see the doctor,
communicate, watch TV, earn, borrow, or even steal.
This book is about the most influential and valuable achievements of
computerized prediction, and the two things that make it possible: the
people behind it, and the fascinating science that powers it.
Making such predictions poses a tough challenge. Each prediction
depends on multiple factors: The various characteristics known about
each patient, each homeowner, each consumer, and each e-mail that
may be spam. How shall we attack the intricate problem of putting all
these pieces together for each prediction?
3GCINTRO 11/26/2015 17:38:58 Page4
4 Introduction
The idea is simple, although that doesn’t make it easy. The challenge is
tackledbyasystematic,scientificmeanstodevelopandcontinuallyimprove
prediction—to literally learn to predict.
The solution is machine learning—computers automatically developing
new knowledge and capabilities by furiously feeding on modern society’s
greatest and most potent unnatural resource: data.
“Feed Me!”—Food for Thought for the Machine
Data is the new oil.
—European Consumer Commissioner Meglena Kuneva
The only source of knowledge is experience.
—Albert Einstein
In God we trust. All others must bring data.
—William Edwards Deming (a business professor famous
for work in manufacturing)
Most people couldn’t be less interested in data. It can seem like such dry,
boring stuff. It’s a vast, endless regimen of recorded facts and figures, each
alone as mundane as the most banal tweet, “I just bought some new
sneakers!”It’stheunsalted,flavorlessresiduedepositedenmasseasbusinesses

Don’t be fooled! The truth is that data embodies a priceless collection of
experiencefromwhichtolearn.Everymedicalprocedure,creditapplication,

(that’s a 1 with 18 zeros after it). And so a veritable Big Bang has set off,
delivering an epic sea of raw materials, a plethora of examples so great in
number,onlyacomputercouldmanagetolearnfromthem.Usedcorrectly,
computers avidly soak up this ocean like a sponge.

Introduction 5
Asdatapilesup,wehaveourselvesagenuinegoldrush.Butdataisn’tthe
gold. I repeat, data in its raw form is boring crud. The gold is what’s
discovered therein.
The process of machines learning from data unleashes the power of this
exploding resource. It uncovers what drives people and the actions they
take—what makes us tick and how the world works. With the new
knowledge gained, prediction is possible.
This learning process discovers insightful gems such as:1
• Early retirement decreases your life expectancy.
• Online daters more consistently rated as attractive receive less interest.
• Rihanna fans are mostly political Democrats.
• Vegetarians miss fewer flights.
• Local crime increases after public sporting events.
Machine learning builds upon insights such as these in order to develop
predictive capabilities, following a number-crunching, trial-and-error pro-
cess that has its roots in statistics and computer science.

The Limits and Potential of Prediction
An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted
yesterday didn’t happen.
—Earl Wilson
How come you never see a headline like “Psychic Wins Lottery”?
—Jay Leno
Each of the preceding accomplishments is powered by prediction, which is
in turn a product of machine learning. A striking difference exists between
thesevariedcapabilitiesandsciencefiction:Theyaren’tfiction.Atthispoint,
I predict that you won’t be surprised to hear that those examples represent

only a small sample. You can safely predict that the power of prediction is
here to stay.
But are these claims too bold? As the Danish physicist Niels Bohr put it,
“Predictionisverydifficult,especiallyifit’saboutthefuture.”Afterall,isn’t
prediction basically impossible? The future is unknown, and uncertainty is
the only thing about which we’re certain.
Let me be perfectly clear. It’s fuzzy. Accurate prediction is generally not
possible.Theweatherispredictedwithonlyabout50percentaccuracy,and
it doesn’t get easier predicting the behavior of humans, be they patients,
customers, or criminals.
Good news! Predictions need not be accurate to score big value. For
instance, one of the most straightforward commercial applications of
3GCINTRO 11/26/2015 17:38:59 Page14

predictive technology is deciding whom to target when a company sends
direct mail. If the learning process identifies a carefully defined group of
customerswhoarepredictedtobe,say,threetimesmorelikelythanaverage

tively removing likely nonresponders from the mailing list. And those non-
responders in turn benefit, contending with less junk mail.
Prediction—Apersonwhoseesasalesbrochuretodaybuysa

In this way the business, already playing a sort of numbers game by
conducting mass marketing in the first place, tips the balance delicately
yet significantly in its favor—and does so without highly accurate predic-
tions. In fact, its utility withstands quite poor accuracy. If the overall
marketing response is at 1 percent, the so-called hot pocket with three

and trees felled to print unread brochures. An estimated 80 percent of all
e-mail is spam. Risky debtors are given too much credit. Applications for
government benefits are backlogged and delayed. And it’s organizations
that have the data to power the predictions that drive improvements in

New groundbreaking stories of PA in action are pouring in. A few key
ingredients have opened these floodgates:
• wildly increasing loads of data;
• cultural shifts as organizations learn to appreciate, embrace, and inte-
grate predictive technology;
• improved software solutions to deliver PA to organizations.
But this flood built up its potential in the first place simply because
predictive technology boasts an inherent generality—there are just so
manyconceivablewaystomakeuseofit.Wanttocomeupwithyourown
new innovative use for PA? You need only two ingredients.
EACH APPLICATION OF PA IS DEFINED BY:
1. What’s predicted: the kind of behavior (i.e., action, event, or
happening) to predict for each individual, stock, or other kind of
element.
2. What’sdoneaboutit:thedecisionsdrivenbyprediction;theaction
taken by the organization in response to or informed by each
prediction.
Given its open-ended nature, the list of application areas is so broad and
the list of example stories is so long that it presents a minor
data-management challenge in and of itself! So I placed this big list

1. What’s predicted: Which customers will respond to marketing
contact.
2. What’s done about it: Contact customers more likely to respond.
As we saw, this use of PA illustrates The Prediction Effect.
The Prediction Effect: A little prediction goes a long way.
Let’s take a moment to see how straightforward it is to calculate the
sheer value resulting from The Prediction Effect. Imagine you have a
company with a mailing list of a million prospects. It costs $2 to mail to
each one, and you have observed that one out of 100 of them will buy
yourproduct(i.e.,10,000responses).Youtakeyourchancesandmailto

If you profit $220 for each rare positive response, then you pocket:

Whip out your calculator—that’s $200,000 profit. Are you happy yet? I

A Faulty Oracle Everyone Loves
The first step toward predicting the future is admitting you can’t.
—Stephen Dubner, Freakonomics Radio, March 30, 2011
The “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make
predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.
—Nate Silver, The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many
Predictions Fail—but Some Don’t
Your resident “oracle,” PA, tells you which customers are most likely to
respond. It earmarks a quarter of the entire list and says, “These folks are
three times more likely to respond than average!” So now you have a
short list of 250,000 customers of whom 3 percent will respond—7,500
responses.

That’s$1,150,000profit.Youjustimprovedyourprofit5.75timesoverby
mailing to fewer people (and, in so doing, expending fewer trees). In
particular, you predicted who wasn’t worth contacting and simply left
them alone. Thus you cut your costs by three-quarters in exchange for
losing only one-quarter of sales. That’s a deal I’d take any day.
It’s not hard to put a value on prediction. As you can see, even if
predictions themselves are generated from sophisticated mathematics, it
takes only simple arithmetic to roll up the plethora of predictions—some
accurate, and others not so much—and reveal the aggregate bottom-line
effect. This isn’t just some abstract notion; The Prediction Effect means
business.

reason, most online ads are not personalized for the individual user—even

medical science we don’t want to know . . . just how cancer works; we

From medical issues to consumer preferences, individualization trumps
universals. And so it goes with ads:

So how did these models predict each click?
Elementary, My Dear: The Power of Observation
Just like Sherlock Holmes drawing conclusions by sizing up a suspect,
prediction comes of astute observation: What’s known about each indi-
vidual provides a set of clues about what he or she may do next. The
chance a user will click on a certain ad depends on all sorts of elements,
includingtheindividual’scurrentschoolyear,gender,ande-maildomain

(Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.); the ratio of the individual’s SAT written-
to-mathscores(istheusermoreaverbalpersonormoreamathperson?),
and on and on.
In fact, thiswebsitecollected a wealthof information aboutits users. To
find out which grants and scholarships they’re eligible for, users answer
dozens of questions about their school performance, academic interests,
extracurricular activities, prospective college majors, parents’ degrees, and
more.Sothetableoflearningdatawaslong(at50millionexamples)andwas

at the moment the person viewed an ad.
It cansound likea tall order: harnessing millions ofexamples inorder to learn
howtoincorporatethevariousfactoidsknownabouteachindividualsothatpredictionis
possible. But we can break this down into a couple of parts, and suddenly it
gets much simpler. Let’s start with the contraption that makes the predic-
tions,theelectronicSherlockHolmesthatknowshowtoconsiderallthese
factors and roll them up into a single prediction for the individual.
Predictivemodel—amechanismthatpredictsabehaviorofanindividual,suchasclick,
buy, lie, or die. It takes characteristics of the individual as input and provides a
predictivescoreasoutput.Thehigherthescore,themorelikelyitisthattheindividual

3GC01 11/26/2015 17:49:22 Page35
Liftoff!PredictionTakesAction 35
Each element counts toward or against the final score for that individual.
This is called a linear model, generally considered quite simple and limited,
although usually much better than nothing.
Other models are composed of rules, like this real example:
IF the individual
is still in high school
AND
expects to graduate college within three years
AND
indicates certain military interest
AND
has not been shown this ad yet
THEN the probability of clicking on the ad for the Art Institute is
13.5percent.
Thisruleisavaluablefind,sincetheoverallprobabilityofrespondingto
theArtInstitute’sadisonly2.7percent,sowe’veidentifiedapocketofavid
clickers, relatively speaking.
Itisinterestingthatthosewhohaveindicatedamilitaryinterestaremore
likely to show interest in the Art Institute. We can speculate, but it’s
important not to assume there is a causal relationship. For example, it
maybethatpeoplewhocompletemoreoftheirprofilearejustmorelikely
to click in general, across all kinds of ads.

guiding which action to take.

Predictive modeling generates the entire model from scratch. All the
model’s math, weights, or rules are created automatically by the computer.
The machine learning process is designed to accomplish this task, to
mechanically develop new capabilities from data. This automation is the
means by which PA builds its predictive power.

The predictive score for each individual directly informs the decision of
what action to take with that individual. Doctors take a second look at
patients predicted to be readmitted, and service agents contact customers
predicted to cancel. Predictive scores issue imperatives to mail, call, offer a
discount,recommendaproduct,showanad,expendsalesresources,audit,investigate,
inspect for flaws, approve a loan, or buy a stock. By acting on the predictions

A Perilous Launch
Dr. John Elder bet it all on a predictive model. He concocted it in the lab,
packed it into a black box, and unleashed it on the stock market. Some
peoplemaketheirownbedinwhichtheymustthenpassivelylie.ButJohn
had climbed way up high to take a leap of faith. Diving off a mountaintop
with newly constructed, experimental wings, he wondered how long it

How do you prove a machine is broken if you’re not allowed to look

vindication; if not, lingering uncertainty. The task at hand was to reverse

incorporate the very thing it was designed to foresee—tomorrow’s stock

2. Literature Review
ERP systems store vast amounts of data related to business processes, but their method of recording ac-
tivities often results in unclear event logs [5]. While many studies focus on developing new algorithms for
the automatic discovery of business processes in ERP systems, our research addresses how organizations
can apply process mining to analyze and improve these processes. Unlike BPMS or workflow-based sys-
tems, which systematically store events and facilitate process mining, ERP systems pose unique data han-
dling challenges. The CRISP-DM methodology, a standard for data mining and knowledge discovery pro-
jects, involves three key analytical capabilities: reporting, classification, and forecasting [5]. Data miners
typically use multiple analytical methods for optimal results. This paper aims to enhance the usability and
understandability of process mining techniques by applying the CRISP-DM methodology to ERP con-
texts, with specific implementation tools and step-by-step coordination. Our study confirms that data dis-
covery from ERP systems enhances strategic and operational decision-making.
In the realm of large-scale software systems such as telecommunication, information systems, and online
applications, understanding failures and behavior patterns often relies on analyzing operational logs or
traces due to the sheer volume of data generated, often in gigabytes daily [6]. This poses challenges in
predicting critical issues or identifying significant behavior patterns in real or near-real-time. Event pro-
cessing, focused on interpreting data as events and issuing alerts based on predefined rules, addresses this
need. Meanwhile, predictive analytics leverages historical data to forecast future events using advanced
techniques like machine learning, akin to event processing methods such as data filtering and correlation.
This survey paper explores both fields, examining terminology, research progress, existing solutions, and
unresolved issues, emphasizing their relevance to the telecommunication domain through analysis of ac-
ademic literature, technical reports, tools, and web logs [6].
This paper aims to tackle significant challenges in the integration of big data analytics with enterprise
information systems (EIS). It proposes an ontology framework for big data analytics and introduces
BABES, a model designed to seamlessly incorporate big data analytics services into EIS [7]. By address-
ing these issues, the research anticipates fostering advancements in EIS development, business analytics,
big data analytics, business intelligence, and intelligent agent technologies [7].
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems encompass a wealth of enterprise data, facilitating compre-
hensive analysis through Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques. OLAP tools offer decision
makers diverse summarized views and graphical representations of ERP data [8]. In contrast, Data Mining
techniques delve deeper, uncovering latent patterns and insights previously unknown. This paper presents
a comparative case study examining the benefits derived from applying OLAP versus data mining tech-
niques individually, as well as the synergistic effects of integrating both approaches within ERP environ-
ments [8].
The demand for continuous monitoring (CM) is on the rise, driven by stringent regulatory mandates fol-
lowing collapses of multinational firms [9]. This research introduces an automated system that leverages
a large dataset of accounts payable transactions to simulate CM implementation. The system's strength
lies in its capability to translate business rules into configurable controls, enabling assessment of transac-
tions against expected outcomes. The study showcases how CM can be applied effectively, utilizing con-
textual meta-data for comprehensive audit analyses. Notably, the CM system identified anomalies over-
looked by internal auditors employing traditional methods during their examination of the same dataset.
Such systems hold promise for enhancing insights, transparency, and organizational performance through
continuous monitoring and assurance practices [9].
As agriculture transitions globally from subsistence farming to agribusiness, the significance of agribusi-
ness construction is growing [10]. With increasing globalization and technological advancements, multi-
national agribusiness construction firms are adopting more advanced data processing techniques. How-
ever, the process of negotiating and agreeing on contract prices between contractors and clients remains
complex and underexplored in literature [10]. Typically, contract profitability stands as the pivotal factor
influencing bid decisions. Commercial managers within construction companies often rely on intuition to
estimate prospective contract profitability, crucial for project decisions and financial forecasts. Introduc-
ing a mathematical model to predict contract profitability could greatly benefit commercial managers,

serving as a primary tool or a valuable second opinion. Additionally, understanding how changes in con-
tract attributes affect predicted profitability would be invaluable. The paper demonstrates that both the
VSM and KRR methodologies are feasible for implementation in commercial settings, highlighting the
need for collaboration between scientists and business experts for effective application [10].

www.ijcrt.org © 2016 IJCRT | Volume 4, Issue 1 January 2016 | ISSN: 2320-2882
- Prophet: Developed by Facebook, Prophet is adept at modeling time series data with daily
observations and incorporates seasonality, holidays, and other effects into forecasts. It is useful in ERP
systems for forecasting daily or weekly business metrics [13].
3. Ensemble Methods:
Ensemble methods combine multiple base models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
Examples include:
- Random Forests: Ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training
and outputs the average prediction of individual trees. It excels in handling large datasets with high
dimensionality and complex interactions [14].
- Gradient Boosting: Iteratively builds weak learners (typically decision trees) to minimize errors in
predictions. Gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM are effective in financial
forecasting tasks within ERP systems, offering high predictive power and scalability.
These ML techniques leverage historical data stored in SAP ERP systems to generate forecasts that assist
organizations in strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and risk management. By integrating these
methodologies, businesses can harness predictive analytics to optimize operations and achieve competitive
advantage in dynamic market environments.

1. Introduction
This paper reviews and explores the way that predictive analytic methods are used by scholars in finance, and in
computational fields of study, to make forecasts. A systemic identification of methods and use cases is presented,
specifically drawn from data sourced either internally or externally from financial Information Systems (IS). As a
review,thispaperdoesnotexplainthemodellingprocessitself.Thisisadequatelycoveredinmanytextbooks,suchas
that by Kuhn & Johnson.1 It is instead a compendium of explanatory statistical and computational methods for the
financial services industry, complied using bibliometric and keyword searches. It is relevant to the IS domain as
predictivetechniquesarebeingincreasinglyincorporatedintoDecisionSupportSystems(DSS).Theoutputsareused

Finance isabroadtermassociated with activities incapitalmarkets that encompasses intertemporal andportfolio

The foundation of statistical inference from these time series is the weak stationarity they exhibit in their means,

The term predictive analytics is more commonly applied when moving beyond explanatory statistical models to
computationalprediction.ThelatterarestandardinDSS,andtheformerareincreasinglybeingembeddedintothem.

This raises a key point for IS. A distinction has to be made between internally and externally generated information
anddata.Assuch,section2ofthispaperreviewsthosedatasetsthathavetobeimportedtoanIS,andsection3those
thataregeneratedbyit.Addressingapproachestointernallygatheredrawdatarequiresaninteractivesoftware-based
system. Addressing approaches to external data requires suitable imported data-sets or a system for gathering
distributeddata.
Withinpredictivecomputationalmethods,thelearningprocessiseitherunsupervisedorsupervised.9Unsupervised
learning is a form of descriptive modelling that does not have an identified target variable or label. In finance, an
example would be the reduction of the variables influencing a share price into number of factors. The maximum
commonvarianceofthevariablesisthenassignedascorewhichgivesthefactorexposureofindividualsecurities.In
supervisedlearning,thelabelbycontrast,boththevariablesandthenatureofthedesiredpredictedoutcomeareknown.
Using the example of a share price, this would be used where the past performance and attributes of a security are
knownbuttheanalystwishestopredictthefutureprice.

claim is falsified. It can also group data clusters found in IS, such as customer segmentation for sales targeting or
identificationofdissatisfiedcustomers.Finally,asmentioned,itcanbeusedforforecastingtimeseries.
All predictive analytic models begin with a construction process. As mentioned, the data in the IS can be either
internallyorexternallysourced.TheCrossIndustryStandardProcessModelforDataMining(CISPM-DM)outlines
the steps for the internal data.d This includes gaining an understanding of the context and the data, as well as the
preparationofthatdata.Itdetailsthemodelling,evaluationanddeploymentstages.InthefirststepoftheCISPM,IS
domain experts are required. This is especially the case in finance, as there are extensive theories that explain asset
pricing, the nature of banking and the behaviour of customers. These all require separate modelling. In the data
preparationstage,variablesneedtobecategorisedandtabulatedbyfinancedomainexpertsintoattributes,descriptors,
variables,fieldsandfeatures.Whereexternaldataandcomputationalmethodsareapplied,theISneedtobeadapted
accordingly.

for identifying fraudulent financial transactions. For example Adams et al,11 present a multivariate identification

2.1. Classification methods
Classification methods include Logistic Regression, Na¨ıve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest
Neighbours,DecisionTree,RandomForest,andSupportVectorMachine(SVM).TheseareallcommoninMachine
Learning.

thatcanbecombinedwithclassificationinthiswayincludepredictivetables,co-variancematrices,similarityfunctions,
ArtificialNeuralNetworks(ANN)andtheaforementionedSVMclassifiers.Examplesofhoweachareusedinfinance
arepresentednext.
Predictive tables are used in analysing high frequency and ultra high frequency trading data where volatility
clustering, heavy tails and time of day/week/month anomalies can be identified. For example, Broby et al16 analyse
transaction batch frequency on 1.28 million buy transactions and 1.30 million sell transactions. With this form of
analysis,Fabozzietal17warnthatthespeedoftransactionsincreasestheerrors.Further,thatdatahastobesynthesised

andshowswhatinsightscanbeextractedfrombothinternalandexternalIS.
Manyfinanceproblemsarequadratic.Theseincludeunivariate,whereanunknownvariablehastobepredicted,and
optimization problems. In the former, graphs can be used to predict points on a quadratic function. In the latter,
covariance matrices can be used in the analysis of conditional variances, co-variances and correlations of financial
returns.
Similarity functions play an import part in the financial prediction process. In particular when using certain
parametricandnonparametricregressionsneuralnets,linearandnonlinearclassifiers.Theuseofsimilarityfunctions

these prior bankruptcies based on a weighted sum of their features compared to the company or companies being
investigated.
The usefulness of computational methods in DSS is enhanced when addressing non-linear problems. Artificial
NeuralNetworksandSupportVectorclassifiersarecomputationalunitsthatareparticularlygoodathandlingsuch
non linear financial prediction problems. A review of their use in finance is produced by Coakley and Brown.19
ANN's use a set of inputs in combination with additional inputs from other computational units to decide the
valueofanoutput.Thisallowsthemtocomputebiasadjustmentsandassignweights.Bychangingtheseweights,the
ANNlearnswhattheoptimaloutcomeis.Forexample,ANN'shavebeenusedinfundmanagementtomakestock

proposed trading strategy. They suggest that future research in this area could apply Random Forest methods to
determinewhichfeaturesare likely toproduce betterresults.
2.2. Regression methods
Regressiontechniques,usedinexplanatorymodelling,arealsousedextensivelyinpredictivefinance.Indeed,they
arethemostcommonformofforecastmodelsinDSS.
Themostwidelyusedmodelinfinanceisthecapitalassetpricingmodel(CAPM).Thisisessentiallyasinglefactor
linearregressionmodel:E(Ri)=Rf+B(E(Rm)Rf).ItisbasedontheexpectedreturndependentvariableE(Ri)havinga
linear relationship to the market return E(Rm) explanatory variable. As such, when individual security returns are
regressedagainstthemarket,theresultingslopedeliversthevolatilityofasecurity'sreturnrelativetothevolatilityof

Thereareofcoursemanytypesofregression,bothlinearandnonlinear,singleormultiple.Manytimeseriesexhibit
correlations but in finance it is difficult to identify whether the correlation between two or more variables is causal.
Further,regressionssufferfromanumberofissuesincludingomittedvariables,reversecausality,mismeasurementand

When performing regression analysis to make predictions, the numerical output needs to be supplemented by a

ortoleranceintervals.22warnofp-hacking,themanipulationofdatatoobtaindesiredp-values.Theyfindthisprevalent
infinancialpapersthatuseofpanelregressionstotestforcrosssectionalequityriskfactors.
Another way to incorporate a degree of confidence is to use quantile regression.23 This method calculates the
conditional median of the least squares rather than the mean (or any percentage of a particular value). It has the
advantage of being able to order and sort samples. For example, there is dispersion and skew between the top paid
employeesinacompanyandthebottompaidones.24thereforeusethisapproachtoidentifyifconditionally(predicted)
high wage employees have a link between pay and performance than conditionally low-wage employees. Within
finance,thisisusefulwheretheconditionsofnormalorlinearrelationshipsarenotpresent,forexamplewherethedata

Thereasonfinancescholarsuseregressionsistoreducecomplexrelation-shipsfoundbetweenmanyvariables.As
mentioned, the CAPM does this well. The normal distribution assumption, however, is just that, an assumption.
ComputationalmethodsdonotstartwiththatasabasisandassucharewellsuitedtoDSS.
2.3. Clustering and association rule methods
Clustering and association rules are descriptive unsupervised classification approaches for data in IS when the
various groupings, classifications and sub classifications are unknown. Within finance Aghabozorgi et al,25 suggest
they are important techniques for the understanding of time series. It also facilitates the visualization of the data re-
lationships. For ex-ample, they can be used to classify securities into groups that share common characteristics and

Associationrules(AR)useMachineLearning(ML)modelstocheckforpatternsorrelatedeventsinadatabase.For

Theinternal structure ofatimeseriesmay alsoexhibit autocorrelation,suchaswhennew information onastockis
gradually,ratherthaninstantlyreflectedinitsprice.Becauseofthis,regressionsarelesseffectiveonsuchdataseries.
As a result, predictive analytics can be applied using autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive
movingaverage(ARMA)andautoregressiveintegratedmovingaverage(ARIMA)models.28Also,moresophisticated
conditional modelling can be applied that utlitizes autoregressive conditional hetroskedasity (ARCH) and GARCH
models.
ARMA, ARIMA,ARCHandGARCHareusedaccordingtoonesas-sumptionofthenatureofthefinancialtime

(timevaryingwithadelay).ARMA(stationary)andARIMA(integrated)arebothflexiblepredictivemethods,however
theyarenotappropriatetoaddressnonlinearityandvolatility,bothcommonfeaturesoffinancialtime series.ARCH
(conditional) and GARCH (lagged) conditional models are better in this respect, and therefore more widely used in
financialtime series forecasting.Thisisalso relevantbecause financialreturns typicallyhaveanoutlier-prone distri-
bution.ARCHorGARCHmodelscanbeusedtocapturethiseffect involatility.
GARCH and ARCH models are used in many conditional asset pricing applications.29 find that conditional co-
variances of securities are variable over time and are an important determinant of time-varying risk premia. Within
economics, time series models are often combined with Bayesian models in order to make forecasts of trends and
cycles.30Theycanalso,aswiththeotherstatistical techniques,becombinedwithcomputationalmethods.
3. Predictive analytics using external information and data
Organizational IS that source data from customers, vendors, regulators, and competitors are better able to make
informedpredictionsthanthosethatjustrelyoninternallygenerateddata.Externaldatareferstosyndicatedata,which
isdatasourcedfrom datasuppliers,suchasBloomberg,Reuters,Datastream,andNielsenIQ.Thereareanumberof
externaldatasetsthatareparticularlywellsuitedtomachinelearning,including,Quandl,IMF,Simfin,GlobalFinancial
DevelopmentandEurostat.
There is limited literature on acquisition of external data and its integration into a banks IS or data warehouses.
Indeed, not all banks have an integrated data warehouse due to cost and complexity issues.31 provide an interesting
study on the subject. They conclude that the motive for banks to develop a data warehouse is to analyze and track
customerbehaviourandtoincreaseoperatingefficiency.
3.1. Economic prediction
Fromthetopdown,predictingthefuturedirectionoftheeconomyisimportanttoalmostallaspectsoffinance.As
mentioned, time series models are popular autoregressive amongst scholars and these are almost exclusively from
externaldatabases. That said, they canbeintegrated with corporate IS andindeed areattheresearch departmentsof
largeinvestmentbanks.
Thereisasubstantialamountofpeerreviewedpapersthatusepredictivemethodsineconomics.Mostly,theseare
regression based. Such Prediction models include linear or logistic regressions. Nonlinear methods include many of
those introduced such as classification models, random forests and penalized regression such as Least Absolute
ShrinkageandSelectionOperator(LASSO)andleast-angle(LARS)regressions.
Themostcommonpredictiveapproachistouseastochasticvectordif-ferenceequationwithaneventthatrequires
policyaction.Theanalystthenspecifiesamodelbasedonassumptionsrelatedtotheexogenousvariables.Examples
include the Wharton model (MARK III) and various ARIMA mod-els which forecast quarterly macroeconomic
variables.102
Following the financial crisis of 2008, there was an increase in papers us-ing predictive analytics to forecast and
model such events. For example, Cao & Cao32 present a Coupled Market State Analysis (CMSA), where a set of
dynamicstatesrepresentsacrisisinducedbythedynamicmarketinteractions.Thepredictedoutcomeoutperformeda
number of other approaches including ANN and logistic regressions. A survey of the ANN methods in finance is
providedbyHuangetal.33Theydistinguishbetweenuni-variateandmultivariateforecasting.
Theeconomyis,however,fundamentallyuncertain.Assuch,thereisalackofobservedaccuracyinthepredictions

performance are its complexity. The later is defined by the number of model parameters and their corresponding re-
lationships.35 propose a model confidence set (MCS) to help econometricians choose between models given a pre-
determinedlevelofconfidence.
3.2. Earnings prediction
Corporateearningsareeasiertoforecastthantheeconomy,althoughtheytoohaveahighdegreeofidiosyncratic
complexity. As with economic variables, the data has to be sourced from an external vendor. Unlike in economics,
however,regressionsarenotgoodpredictivetechniques.Nonlinearmodelssuchastreeinductionalgorithms,neural
networks, naive Bayesian learning, and genetic algorithms have had better success in forecasting earnings Neural
networks,forexample,canbeusedtoforecastearningsbasedongoodness-of-fitandadditionaltrainingfactorsinthe
errorfunctionincludingnetprofit,direction,andtimehorizon.36
Using computational methods to predict corporate earnings addresses the twin issues of objectivity and indepen-
dence in human analysts and as such are well suited to DSS. The issue of accuracy is, however, very pertinent to
valuation, a common objective of predictive models in finance. SVM therefore may have an edge when used in a
systemscontext.37checkedtheresultsoftheirownsupportvectorregressionpredictiononquarterlyearningsandfound

Many investors and financial service companies make fundamental forecasts and base investment strategies on
them.46 A smaller number make technical forecasts based on historic price movements. Although the latter is
consideredineffective,manyofthepredictivemodelsarebasedonthisapproach.47–49

Binsbergen58 argue that to use the dynamic CAPM to make predictions one should use the Variance Risk Premium

that predictiveanalytics inthis area involveincreasedmodel complexity andmay lack explanatory insights.Despite

Predictive analytics can also be used for enforcement. For example, Sudjianto et al104 documented the statistical
methods for predicting money laundering. Typically, a profile of legitimate behavior is compared with a money

ThisisdoneusingaBayesratiorelatedmetric.

tomers has also been investigated. A number of methods have been used to predict customer retention including
CustomerLifeTimeValue:HybridDataMining,MarkovChain,Optimization,AnalyticalHierarchyProcess,SVM,
and Quantile Regression. Neslin et al68 investigated three other methods, logistic regression, decision tree and
discriminant analysis for accuracy. They conclude the discriminant approach is the least accurate. Lazarov et al69
provide a good overview of the various methods. Kumar & Chandrakala70 suggest SVM is the best approach, They

4.4. Financial and credit fraud prediction
Financial markets attract fraudsters and DSS are used to identify these early. Reurink89 classify the literature on
financial fraud into three streams, namely false financial disclosures, fraudulent financial schemes, and financial
misselling.Thetechniquesusedintheliteratureincludeacombinationofstatistical,datavisualization,datamining,and
filteringtools.
Perolsetal90pointoutthatpredictionismadedifficultduetotherarityoffraud,thelargenumbersofexplanatory
variablesandthelargenumberofdifferenttypesoffraud.Ngaietal91provideaclassificationandliteraturereviewon
the latter. It is clear from their work, and the work of other scholars, that successful frauds are complex and hard to
detect. Forexample,fraudulent activity atMadoffInvestmentSecuritiesLLC wasdocumented for tenyears priorto
beingexposedbyafundmanagerwhomathematicallyshowedthattheperformancetrackrecordwasmathematically

used on a large volume of data in combination with machine learning algorithms, data mining approaches such as
supportvectorandrandomforest,togetherwithmoretraditionallogisticregressions.Alltheseapproachesarebasedon
a benchmark data-set of normal spending patterns. In this way, it is possible to detect unusual spending patterns or
fraudsinrealtime.
Supervised and unsupervised predictive analytic approaches are used to detect credit card fraud. In supervised
approaches,modelsarebasedoncomparingtwosamples,onewithcleanlegitimatetransactionsandonewithknown
fraud. It is then possible to teach the machine to classify new transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. In un-
supervisedapproaches,modelsarealsobasedoncomparingtwosamples,onewithcleanlegitimate transactionsand

4.5. Cyber crime prediction
Aswithotherpredictivemethods,bothstatisticalandcomputationalmethodsareusedinDSStopredictcybercrime.
The most common include various forms of regression and time-series. The computational approaches include Arti-
ficialGeneralIntelligence(AGI),ANN,ML,geneticalgorithms,fuzzylogic,NLPandrobotics.Often,thetechniques

includedenialofservice,corporateblackmail,cyberbullying,stalking,scams,robbery,identitytheft,defamationand

Much of the literature on prediction focuses on determining the magnitude of an event once it has started.96; for
example,predicttheseverityofdenialofserviceattacks.Thechallengewiththeseapproachesisgettingthedatafrom
theinternetratherthananIS.
An interesting approach was taken by Ho et al97 who investigated spontaneous deception by analysing language
used in interactive online games. They used logistic regressions on this data and found that deceptive players had
certainlanguagetraitsthatcouldbepredicted.Theseincludecognitiveload,latency,andwordiness.

6. Conclusion
This paper presented a rich variety of methods in its review of predictive analytics in finance. A keyword index
search was made which covered the explanatory statistical techniques and computational models. This was done
throughareviewofthetopcontributingauthorsfromthedisciplinesofInformationSystems,Finance,Computingand
Management Science. The identified scholars all utilised predictive analytics in their research. Their analytic and
methodologicalchoiceswereidentifiedinthecontextoftheirresearch.Itwasshownthatscholarsusedsuchmethodsto
deliverstatisticalresults,descriptiveoutputs,decisionforecastsandoptimizedoutcomes.Itissuggestedthatthesecan
all be embedded in DSS to aid management decision making. This allows management to combine IS data with
computationalpower,therebyenhancingtheabilitytomakebetterfinancial,investmentandlendingdecisions.
ItwasshownthatstatisticalandcomputationaltechniquessourcedfromIS,eitherexternallyorinternally,havebeen
used by academics to solve a number of financial questions. These include the use of external data to forecast the
economyandcorporateearnings.Inthisrespect,predictivemodelswereshowntohavebeenusedincombinationwith

Executive Summary
This first white paper of the new series discusses the value of predictive analytics for the financial industry and answers the
question why this is the right time to start with predictive analytics and how to empower entire organisations to use it.
As mobile technology evolves and everything around us – not just our mobile devices– is becoming connected we are
entering a new era of connected experiences. The customer journey in the financial industry is completely digitized. This
exponentially increases the number of interactions between a financial service company and its customers. Customers
expect banks to understand their context and the challenge for financial industry is to be relevant at all these interactions.
Given the gold mine of data that banks have access to, the field of predictive analytics offers a range of untapped
opportunities in doing so. When implemented successfully, predictive analytics will lead to vast improvements of existing
static business rules and achieve progress like reducing cost, increasing revenues and improving customer experience.
Mobey Forum expects that predictive analytics skills will soon be essential for banks to keep their position in the market
against non-banks but also other banks that will be using predictive analytics as a competitive weapon. That’s why building
skills that go beyond the conventional descriptive analytics and focusing on the question “what will happen?” has to be top
priority for every financial institution.
To understand the concept of predictive analytics the paper discuss the difference between descriptive and predictive
analytics. The majority of business analytics at financial institutions is currently still focussed on the ‘rear view mirror’,
resulting in descriptive analytics. The questions more concerned with the future mainly remained unanswered from an
analytics point of view. These decisions are often made intuitively and are seldom fact based, often resulting in sub-optimal
decisions. With predictive analytics we do identify and address questions concerned with the future. We learn from our
experience and predict future behaviour in order to drive better decisions.
Used effectively, there are several areas of application for predictive analytics where financial institutions could make
profitable investments while at the same time improving the attractiveness of their services. Mobey Forum is mentioning
examples like card linked offers, next best action, pricing, claim handling, risk assessment to mention few.
But as always, where are many opportunities, there are also many challenges to be solved. Effective usage of predictive
analytics is only possible in a data-driven organization. It all comes down to having access to right "past data" and using
right skills, techniques and tools to find business relevant patterns that can be used to solve similar problems in the future.
The challenges in the different phases of the predictive analytics lifecycle are discussed in the paper.
Considering the challenges and opportunities ahead, the final advice is to start now. But start small, create successful
examples and iterate towards leveraging predictive analytics in to your organization.
This paper will help you to start. It explains the most important components, challenges and key application areas of
predictive analytics in the financial industry.

1.2 Why this is the right time for
Predictive Analytics within Financials?
The customer: Growing expectations regarding service and relevance
In today’s data economy being able to apply powerful data-gathering and analysis is no longer good enough. Customers’
expectations about services in general are increasing and expectations in the customer experience field are set here by
companies like Google and Apple. Google, the company that coined the “mobile-first” expression is moving to “AI-first” and is
evolving from an information retrieval company to informing and assisting. Think of the Google Now service, which tells you
when to leave for your appointment. Customers expect this kind of added value, and expect it to be neither annoying nor
inaccurate. In information retrieval, anything over 80% recall and precision is pretty good. When assisting a customer, customer
expectation rises to almost 100% accuracy (see also chapter 4). This is something that is only possible when the data quality is
high and predictive analytics capabilities are outstanding.2
Financial institutions should therefore empower customers by creating real-time insights into their financial situation and
offer personalized insights, services, and advice throughout their mobile decision journey. Predictive Analytics is becoming
competitive ground and fundamental for these kind of innovations in financial services.
The smartphone: The perfect communication channel is already created
The perfect communication channel is already created By having an app on virtually all their customers' smart phones, the banks
have created an ideal distribution channel for their products and market communication; It is always within arm’s reach and
offers a variety of options for real-time, two-way dialogue. Simultaneously, the smart phone is also an important source of data
(for instance geolocation), which makes it possible to offer the customer advice, information and products that are relevant to
his location or purchase situation.
Globally, the base of mobile banking customers is set to rise from 0.8 billion people in 2014 to 1.8 billion by 2019* (Juniper
Research, KPMG analysis).3 In Western countries, around 40% of all people are using mobile banking apps. In China and India,
these numbers are around 60-70%.4 Adding the introduction of other wearables, the amount of data that can be collected for
even more accurate personal contextual messaging will increase dramatically in the near future.

The data: Digitization increased the number of potential data sources
Digitization of every aspect of our life has increased the number of potential data sources and the amount of data that can be
captured and stored, some structured but mostly unstructured data. The wave of technologies that were originally developed
by Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Yahoo emerged as viable advanced data storage and
processing alternatives to existing commercial Relational Database Management System and Business Intelligence tools. The
costs of storing data have fallen below the costs of deciding which data to keep and which to delete. Computational processing
power increases exponentially allowing us to do analytics at scale and in nearly real-time. Suddenly, Terabytes, Petabytes and
even Zettabytes were part of the conversation for small start-ups like Airbnb and Uber looking to disrupt previously untouched
markets by putting data-driven advanced analytics capabilities at the very core of their value propositions. Similar to these
companies, a future-proof bank stores and matches all data which is gathered during the complete online and offline journey
of its customers. This results in a real time 360-degree customer view which creates a perfect foundation for predictive analytics.
The competition: Upcoming changes in regulation will create new areas of competition
Financial institutions are constantly looking for new sources of differentiation, revenue and customer loyalty. The next few years
provide great opportunity for financial institutions to prepare for an environment of open competition on the usage of customer
data. Upcoming changes in data regulation in the EU could radically change the market environment for financial institutions
when it comes to predictive analytics. In Europe regular financial services such as payments may be reduced to a commodity
where due to the Payment Service Directive anyone with a payment licence can compete for customer payment data. So
financial institutions need to leverage their use of data in order to remain relevant to their customers. Once the customer can
freely decide with whom to share their transactional data a new competitive area will emerge. In this competitive environment
banks will compete with non-banks and with each other for the right to use their customers’ data. So if we look back to the
previous Mobey Forum reports on the competitive aspects of mobile wallets we could state that not payment itself but payment
data based services are becoming “the last mile” in the war of wallets. The better financial institutions use the remaining time
until the existing regulation is in place to improve their skills, implement new tools and change the processes and requirements
to their data analysis output, the easier they will be able to transit to the new reality. The current window of opportunity is
closing. Banks had better start today.

2.1 Four types of business analytics
To explain the concept of predictive analytics it must be viewed in relation to other common types of business analytics. Gartner
distinguishes four types of business analytics; descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics.

2.4. The main components of predictive analytics
As a manager in any industry, it helps to understand the main components of predictive analytics. The Harvard Business Review
article “A Predictive Analytics Primer” lists the three basic components that underlie predictive analytics: 6

model (or size of the dataset!).
Machine Learning and Big Data are terms heard often in the field of predictive analytics. Neither of which are necessary for a predictive
analytics use case, but they do offer fast-growing opportunities. The framework above enables us to address these terms and explain
how they relate to predictive analytics.
2.5 The Data: It’s about using high quality data, not about size
It is important to emphasize that predictive analytics is not about the size of the data, but about using the data to improve decision
support. A regular customer database including variables like age, postal code, product purchases and contact history could be a
great starting point for building a powerful predictive model. Often, organizations already face challenges in ensuring the quality
of these types of data. The current lack of predictive analytics use cases within financial institutions is an incentive to start small,
rather than directly incorporating ‘Big Data’ in your predictive analytics cases. Said differently, more low quality data is not likely to
improve predictive capabilities. If you succeeded in creating an understandable model and you want to increase predictive power
or robustness you can start incorporating more and different data sources in your model, slowly building towards a “big data”
environment.
Big data is a popular term used in many different ways, but mainly referring to data that is too complex to be managed by traditional
analytics methodologies and tools. Although there are many different definitions, the common phenomenon people have been
using to further describe big data are the four V’s. There is an increase in scale (Volume), forms (Variety), speed of generation (Velocity)
and uncertainty (Veracity) of data sources when it comes to big data. In the end, opportunities of predictive analytics will obviously
increase when other and larger amounts of data are stored. But the fourth V (Veracity) will give additional challenges when including
big data sources in predictive analytics.

2.7 The assumptions and its limitations
The number one reason making the assumptions of a predictive model invalid is time. Has the new input data changed in comparison
to the historic data used to create the predictive model? Is it necessary to create a new predictive model because the old model doesn’t
work well with the new data? Are all the key variables used in the old model still relevant? As Nicolas Taleb describes in his book Black
Swan8 , the model that predicts the Turkey’s well-being for the first thousand days of its life doesn’t predict the fatal thousandth and
first tragic day. It looks like some key variables were missing in its well-being model which relevance for model’s accuracy became
evident two days before Thanksgiving.
Finally, even if the assumptions still apply to the current situation predicting the right outcome doesn’t necessarily mean that this
outcome can in every case be influenced. Some things will happen no matter if we were able to predict them upfront or not. So
predicting that ‘the chance of rain is 90% in the upcoming 24 hours’ like mentioned before, won’t enable us to prevent the rainfall.
Other future predicted outcomes can directly be influenced. When a bank is able to predict which customers are likely to churn, action
can be taken and the customer behaviour might change.

Key areas to create
value with predictive
analytics for financial
services
Used effectively, there are several areas of application for predictive analytics where financial institutions could make profitable
investments while at the same time improving the attractiveness of their services. From a high-level business perspective, value for
business breaks down to commercial effectiveness, risk control, operational efficiency and financial control. This so-called ‘Value Tree’
can be used to structure the different use cases of predictive analytics for financial industry.
When focussing on commercial effectiveness, examples of predictive analytics are card linked offers or next best action marketing.
If operational efficiency is the goal, predictive analytics can for instance be useful in a predictive maintenance case. The one to one
relationships between the example and the created value for the business will not always be so straightforward. If predictive analytics is
used to decrease the down time of ATM’s (predictive maintenance), this might also increase customer satisfaction and retention.
In this white paper the highlighted cases are discussed in more detail, the majority of these serve multiple goals and create value for
the bank and the customer.9

Predictive Analytics in the Financial Industry
Card linked offers
Several financial institutions are looking into new business models, where
their customers are offered discounts from retailers, provided that they use
the banks' card. So called ‘card linked’ offers have been around for a while,
but has great potential when combined with analytics to ensure the offers
are well timed and contextually appropriate from a consumers' point of view.
And when this ‘card’ is placed in the context of a mobile application and/
or mobile payment capability, the opportunity for the delivery of content-
rich, timely, and relevant messaging is increased dramatically. Aggregating
payment information across different payment service relationships of a
single customers is also one of attractive value propositions for non-banks
(see PSD2 above).
Next best action marketing
Card linked offers are already an example of next best action marketing, but
the range of actions is mainly focused on making a new offer. The increased
amount of interactions in the digitized journey offers opportunities to add
value for customers in various ways, more than simply presenting offers.
Financial institutions have extensive knowledge of their customers financial
and lifestyle habits. The banks that are able to use this information to offer
their customers better financial advice and support them in making decisions
could earn both the customers' loyalty and increase sales. During all the
interactions with a customer, banks should constantly evaluate the next best
action. This range of actions is not limited to offers, but can include service,
financial advice, etc. Algorithms constantly evaluate the different actions that
can be taken for a specific customer. The one which is considered the ‘best’ in
terms of timing and relevance is presented to the customer. Just imagine what
the opportunities are for the next best action concept in the mobile customer
journey. Since they are prosperous, they are discussed in more detail in the
next chapter.
Pricing
In many countries, comparison sites are gaining popularity and are dominant
in the client acquisition process. For products like savings accounts a rational
customer should always compare interest rates before selecting their product
and offering bank. This evokes a game theoretical question: Given the interest
rates offered by my competitors, what interest rate should I set to balance
customer acquisition and profitability? And if I take a certain action, how
are my competitors likely to respond? Based on past customer behaviour, a
bank can model the in- and outflow of money. Predictions made using these
models provide a fact based instrument and improve the ability of setting the
right interest rate.
16
Risk assessment
More accurate predictions about future behaviour would give the financial
institutions the chance to assess risk even better. This would allow for lower
risk premiums or higher profits by reducing both false positives and false
negatives. From a customer point of view, this would on average be well
received when it is provided with a rational explanation, since no one benefits
from allowing customers to take on debt they are not able to service.
Predictive Maintenance
Customers expect banks to operate 24/7, so the downtime of a bank’s
infrastructure needs to be minimized. For example, an ATM that does not
work frustrates customers. If a bank could predict these types of equipment
failures, maintenance could be scheduled in order to prevent failure or
minimize downtime. This technique is known as predictive maintenance and
this approach is preferred over routine or time-based maintenance, because
tasks are only performed when needed.
Claim handling
Claim management can be a time consuming and costly task for back offices
of insurance companies. Based on components of a claim, such as the value
of the claim, nature of injury, place, characteristics of the claimant and the
customer’s insurance history it is possible to predict which claims are likely to
be fraudulent. These cases clearly need attention and can be prioritized and
assigned to experienced claim handlers. On the contrary it is also possible to
predict which cases are not complex and have a close to zero probability of
being fraudulent. It could be interesting to not assign these cases to a claim
handler, but settle them automatically and transfer the claim amount to the
customer. This decreases claim duration and therefore positively influences
the customer experience.
HR Analytics
HR departments of financial institutions are continuously searching for
potential employees. But which profile to hire? Techniques for using predictive
analytics are available, but not widespread among HR departments of financial
institutions. By analysing data of current employees, HR departments could
determine which variables (age, experience, grades, etc.) contribute the most
to performance and productivity. When hiring new employees this makes it
possible to predict if a certain profile is likely to be successful in the company

The 10 challenges
on the predictive
analytics lifecycle
20
When embarking on the journey of predictive analytics there are challenges that need to be considered and preferably taken care of
before they become non-overcoming hurdles. Overall, a first important task to complete when considering predictive analytics usage
is to determine whether or not your organization is prepared and equipped to work effectively in a data driven environment. It is only
within such a culture that a company will fully benefit from the opportunities of predictive analytics. Predictive Analytics should be
viewed within a broader context of how the Financial collects, stores, accesses and uses customer and transactional data. This context
has both ethical and cultural considerations.
Building a data driven organization should not be considered as an IT and/or intelligence department project. Effective usage of data
will mean a culture change in your organization that’s driven by using analytics and data input in practically every step of your decision-
making processes.
Creating this data driven organization and at the same time enabling the power of predictive analytics is a continuous process. Let’s
examine the ten different challenges on the predictive analytics lifecycle to frame some very basic initial key questions about your
organization’s readiness for successful use of predictive analytics.
Figure 6: The predictive analytics lifecycle. VODW, 2016.
5.1 Data management
Data collection and ownership
When performing data management, the first question is to address is: ‘What data should we collect?’. How can we find the meaningful
data nuggets in a world where the amount of data is doubling every 18 months10? To answer this question, companies should inform
themselves regarding questions like: ‘How much may be stored, used and shared?’ and ‘May we combine data from other data sources?’.
Data Ownership is another crucial topic. Who actually owns the data? Is it the customers’ data or banks data we are dealing with? How
will the ‘right to be forgotten’ influence this? Imagine that aggregated customer data is used for narrowing various outcomes and some of
the customers wants to be forgotten. May financial institutions still use the aggregated data or will this dilute the data that the predictive
analytics uses? There are many unanswered questions and the answers will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is important to (at least
try) to answer these questions, so the analytics can be created on a sound legal basis.

Think big,
start small,
but start now
24
The previous chapter described the hurdles to overcome before predictive analytics can begin to deliver benefits. Since all of these
challenges will become relevant sooner or later when embarking on the journey of predictive analytics, the advice is to be aware of the
range of change ahead, and appreciate that the changes will not be incremental. At the same time, the best advice is to start small and
simple, but start now.
Think big
If the digitization that the financial services industry has witnessed considered as a big step forward, then the shift caused by artificial
intelligence will be immense. In the near future we will experience a level of service provided without any human interaction that
we cannot imagine today. This new benchmark, similarly to mobile services in the past decade, will be set by the players outside of
the financial industry. This will force the industry to adapt, the same reason that we see banks partner with fintechs and start calling
themselves technology companies. This adaptation will be even less incremental than the one we experienced before and will force
financial industry to master predictive analytics and put data at the core of their business. But this doesn’t mean the banks should follow
every technology hype around data and hire hundreds of data scientists.
Start small
Mobey Forum advises starting with a small, multi-disciplinary team and identify a simple goal which delivers value for the business and/
or customer. This multi-disciplinary team should be able to complete the job from start to finish in a relatively short period of time. With
respect to the described journey of predictive analytics this means the team should be able to collect and analyse the relevant data,
build a model and finally use the model to execute some action towards the customer. The team should be allowed to experiment and
work autonomously, enabling them to quickly deliver results which add value. Think, for example, of a predictive churn model for one
single product. Start with a limited number of data sets for this purpose which are easy to synchronize. Create a simple predictive model
and use the model to pro-actively contact customers with a high probability of churn and measure any churn reduction against a similar
control group of customers. Start small, fail, learn and succeed. 9
Start now
Traditionally IT and data projects have a linear and sequential approach. A typical project has a number of phases like target setting,
requirements, design, implementation, verification and maintenance. All phases have fixed deadlines and the actual value of a project for
the business or the customer is delivered when all phases are completed and tasks are done. If this principle is used to build a (big) data
infrastructure which satisfies all needs of the business, it will probably take months or even years before the infrastructure is completed.
Using predictive analytics to gain value from the data will only start after this period. A scenario which should be avoided since the
delivered value for the business or customer is minimal during a long period of time.
Successful examples will create leverage for predictive analytics in the company and will create curiosity and questions from other
department, generating new cases. Now we can move on and start incorporating new data sources. This iterative and incremental
development approach allows you to work towards a ‘big data’ infrastructure on the long term, while constantly generating value for the
business and the customer on the short term. The motto should be think big (data), but start small (data).

Professor Xiaowu Dai, Chair
This thesis investigates the application of machine learning models—Linear Regression,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—in predicting bond market trends,
a critical area of financial forecasting. Using data from 2019 to 2023 sourced from the
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), key economic indicators such as the 10-year
Treasury yield, inflation (CPI), unemployment rate, and Federal Funds Rate were
analyzed. Random Forest demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest
predictive accuracy and lowest error metrics. The research also identifies inflation and
the Federal Funds Rate as the most influential variables, emphasizing the capacity of
machine learning to capture nonlinear relationships and enhance data-driven decision-
making. While promising, the study acknowledges limitations such as a restricted dataset
timeframe and model complexity. Future research directions include exploring advanced

deep learning techniques, kernel transformations for SVM, and expanding the feature set
to include geopolitical and sentiment-based variables. This study contributes to financial
analytics by showcasing how machine learning models can improve forecasting accuracy
and decision-making in bond market analysis.

Financial markets, as a cornerstone of the global economy, are inherently dynamic and
influenced by a multitude of external factors, including monetary policies, geopolitical
events, and investor sentiment. Within this ecosystem, the bond market holds particular
significance, acting as a primary source of capital for governments and corporations while
serving as a barometer for economic stability and investment trends. Accurate predictions
of bond market movements are crucial for investors, policymakers, and financial
institutions seeking to navigate these complexities.
Traditional approaches to bond market analysis, such as fundamental and
econometric models, have historically provided valuable insights. However, these methods
often fall short in capturing the intricate nonlinear relationships and dependencies between
variables characteristic of modern financial systems. For example, bond yield fluctuations
are often influenced by complex interactions among interest rates, inflation, and labor
market conditions, which traditional linear models struggle to encapsulate [1][2].
Advances in machine learning (ML) offer an alternative paradigm for financial
forecasting. Unlike conventional models, ML techniques can uncover hidden patterns in
high-dimensional data, adapt to changing market dynamics, and deliver superior predictive
accuracy. These capabilities make ML particularly well-suited for bond market analysis,
1
addressing the limitations of traditional methods while offering robust tools for decision-
making [3][4].
1.2 Research Objectives and Research Questions.
This thesis explores the application of machine learning models to predict trends in the
bond market, focusing on the performance and suitability of different algorithms. By
leveraging historical data and key economic indicators, the research seeks to address the
following objectives:
1. Develop and evaluate machine learning models, including Linear Regression,
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, for bond market
forecasting.
2. Identify the most influential variables driving bond market trends, such as interest
rates, inflation, and unemployment.
3. Compare the predictive accuracy of different machine learning models and
determine which is best suited for analyzing bond market dynamics.
The guiding research questions are:
• How can machine learning models be effectively utilized to predict trends in the
bond market?
• What are the most influential variables affecting bond market fluctuations?
• Which machine learning models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy in bond
market analysis?
These questions will be explored through the construction, testing, and comparison of
models using economic data from reliable sources, such as the Federal Reserve Economic
2
Data (FRED). The study also seeks to provide insights into feature importance and its
implications for bond yield prediction.
1.3 Importance of Machine Learning in Bond Market Analysis
The adoption of machine learning for bond market analysis marks a significant shift from
traditional econometric methods to data-driven approaches. Machine learning models can
automatically discover nonlinear relationships and interactions in complex datasets,
making them invaluable in dynamic and unpredictable financial environments[4].
The benefits of applying machine learning to bond market analysis include:
1. Enhanced Predictive Accuracy: Machine learning models, such as Random
Forest and Support Vector Machines, can model nonlinear relationships and
capture temporal patterns, providing more precise forecasts of bond yields and
prices [5].
2. Feature Importance Analysis: Techniques like feature importance ranking
enable the identification of key economic indicators, helping to prioritize
variables like inflation and interest rates in predictive modeling [3].
3. Scalability for Large Datasets: Machine learning algorithms can process vast
amounts of data in real time, making them suitable for high-frequency financial
markets and rapidly changing economic conditions [4].
These attributes make machine learning an indispensable tool for modern financial
forecasting, offering investors and policymakers actionable insights for navigating bond
market complexities [1][2][5].

CHAPTER 2
Literature Review
2.1 Overview of Predictive Analytics in Finance
Predictive analytics in finance leverages advanced statistical methods and machine
learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in historical data and make robust forecasts
about financial trends. It has become a central focus for researchers and practitioners
aiming to optimize investment strategies, assess risks, and improve decision-making
processes in financial markets. According to a review by Salehin et al. (2024), machine
learning models such as AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS) have shown
substantial improvements in predictive performance by automating the process of feature
engineering and model selection, thus reducing the time and expertise required for effective
model development [5].
Several studies have explored the potential of machine learning in the bond market.
For example, Gandomi and Haider (2015) reviewed the application of machine learning
techniques in financial forecasting, highlighting the benefits of using non-linear models
such as neural networks for capturing complex patterns in financial time series data [4].
Similarly, a comprehensive review by Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) demonstrated the
effectiveness of supervised learning models, such as support vector machines (SVM) and
decision trees, in predicting bond yields based on economic indicators [2]. These studies
underscore the importance of advanced machine learning methods in enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of bond market predictions.

2.2 Application of Machine Learning in Bond Market Analysis.
Machine learning models have revolutionized bond market analysis by enabling the
processing of high-dimensional data and identifying patterns that traditional models often
overlook. These models are particularly effective in handling non-linear relationships,
capturing temporal dependencies, and reducing manual feature engineering. The models
explored in this study—Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random
Forest—exemplify these capabilities, offering distinct advantages in analyzing bond
market trends.
Linear Regression, as a baseline model, is widely used in financial forecasting due
to its simplicity and interpretability. Although it assumes a linear relationship between
variables, its ease of implementation makes it an important benchmark for assessing the
performance of more complex models. However, its limitation in capturing non-linear
interactions often reduces its predictive accuracy in dynamic markets like the bond market
[2][3].
Support Vector Machines (SVM) provide a more sophisticated approach by
utilizing kernel functions to capture non-linear relationships in the data. By maximizing
the margin between different data classes, SVM offers a robust framework for regression
tasks in financial contexts. However, its performance is highly dependent on
hyperparameter tuning and the choice of kernel functions, which can increase
computational complexity [4].
Random Forest, an ensemble learning method based on decision trees, has
demonstrated significant advantages in bond market analysis. By combining the
predictions of multiple decision trees, Random Forest effectively handles non-linear
5
relationships and interactions between variables. Additionally, its built-in feature
importance ranking provides insights into the factors most influencing bond market trends,
such as interest rates and inflation [5]. This model has been shown to outperform traditional
econometric methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, making it a preferred
choice for financial forecasting [6].
Several studies have validated the effectiveness of these models in bond market
analysis. For instance, Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) demonstrated the utility of tree-
based methods like Random Forest in improving predictions of bond yields, emphasizing
their ability to adapt to complex data structures [3]. Similarly, Gandomi and Haider (2015)
highlighted the potential of kernel-based methods, such as SVM, in capturing intricate
market dynamics that linear models fail to address [4].
In this study, the application of these models highlights the importance of selecting
appropriate algorithms tailored to the complexities of financial markets. While Linear
Regression provides a baseline, Random Forest emerges as the most promising model due
to its ability to balance predictive power with interpretability. SVM, despite its theoretical
advantages, requires extensive optimization to achieve comparable results in bond market
forecasting.
2.3 Challenges and Research Gaps
Despite the growing adoption of machine learning models in financial forecasting, several
challenges remain that hinder their broader applicability.
⚫ Interpretability and Transparency
6
One of the key challenges is the "black-box" nature of many machine learning models,
particularly deep learning and ensemble methods. These models often lack transparency,
making it difficult for financial analysts to understand the reasoning behind predictions.
Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) emphasize that this opacity can limit the trust and adoption
of machine learning methods in decision-making processes, especially in contexts where
accountability and regulatory compliance are critical [2]. Efforts to address this limitation
have included the development of hybrid models that combine traditional econometric
approaches with machine learning techniques, enhancing interpretability while
maintaining predictive performance [7]. For example, tree-based models like Random
Forest inherently offer feature importance rankings, providing some level of insight into
the driving factors of predictions.
⚫ Data Quality and Availability
Another major barrier is data quality and availability. Hentzen et al. (2022) highlight that
the effectiveness of machine learning models heavily depends on the accuracy and
completeness of input data [8]. In the bond market context, missing data points,
inconsistent reporting practices, or biases in historical datasets can significantly affect
model outcomes. Furthermore, the reliance on a limited set of economic indicators may
overlook other influential variables, such as geopolitical events or market sentiment.
Addressing these issues requires the integration of real-time data sources and robust
preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality inputs.
⚫ Computational Complexity and Scalability
Models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest can require substantial
computational resources, especially when applied to large financial datasets or in scenarios
7
involving hyperparameter tuning. This limitation can hinder real-time prediction
capabilities and the scalability of these models for operational use. More efficient
algorithms or optimization techniques could address these computational challenges while
maintaining model performance.
2.4 Future Research Directions
Given the limitations of current machine learning models in bond market analysis, future
research should focus on addressing interpretability, data integration, and methodological
advancements. One promising direction is the development of interpretability tools, such
as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-
agnostic Explanations), which can provide transparency into model predictions and
enhance trust among financial analysts [7]. Expanding feature sets by incorporating real-
time data sources, geopolitical events, and sentiment analysis through Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques could also significantly improve the robustness and
adaptability of models [6]. Moreover, exploring advanced machine learning frameworks,
such as reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid architectures combining deep learning with
traditional statistical methods, could capture the dynamic and nonlinear nature of bond
markets more effectively. RL, for instance, offers potential for modeling optimal strategies
by adapting predictions based on market feedback, while hybrid models can integrate
domain expertise for greater accuracy and interpretability [5]. Finally, improving
computational efficiency through dimensionality reduction, AutoML frameworks, and
distributed computing techniques can address scalability concerns, particularly for real-
8
time applications. Combining these approaches will pave the way for machine learning
models that are more transparent, robust, and practical for predicting bond market trends.
2.5 Conclusion
The literature highlights the transformative potential of machine learning in bond market
analysis, particularly through its ability to model non-linear relationships and process
large datasets. However, challenges related to model interpretability, data quality, and
computational complexity remain significant barriers to broader adoption. Addressing
these limitations through advanced techniques, expanded feature sets, and improved
validation methodologies will be crucial for future advancements. These efforts can
further enhance the practical utility of machine learning in financial forecasting, paving
the way for more robust and actionable insights in the bond market.

CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
This chapter provides an in-depth overview of the research methodology adopted to
predict bond market trends using various machine learning models. The focus is on data
collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection,
experimental design, and evaluation criteria. Visualizations, such as histograms,
correlation matrices, and time series plots, are used to explore the dataset and gain
insights into the economic variables affecting bond yields. These analyses are integral for
understanding the dataset’s structure and guiding the subsequent model development.
3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing
3.2.1 Data Sources
The dataset used in this study was obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED) through the pandas_datareader library. FRED, managed by the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis, provides a comprehensive set of historical and real-time economic
data, which is crucial for analyzing financial markets. The selected variables span the
period from January 2019 to December 2023, covering recent economic developments.
The specific variables included in the analysis are as follows:
10
1. 10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10): Represents the long-term interest rates in the
U.S. financial market. It serves as the dependent variable in this research and is a key
indicator of market performance and economic health.
2. Unemployment Rate (UNRATE): Reflects the overall condition of the labor
market and is a leading indicator of economic activity.
3. Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL): Measures inflation, affecting bond yields by
influencing investor expectations of future interest rates.
4. Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS): The interest rate at which depository
institutions lend reserve balances to each other overnight, a critical factor affecting bond
yields.
These variables were selected due to their established relevance in influencing
bond market dynamics, as supported by previous research [2][3]. Table 3.1 provides
descriptive statistics for the variables, offering an initial view of their distribution over
the study period:
11
Table 3.1 Descriptive Statistics of Economic Indicators
Variable Mean Standard Min Max
Deviation
10-Year Treasury Yield 2.22 1.18 0.62 4.77
Unemployment Rate 5.08 2.66 3.5 14.8
Consumer Price Index 276.85 19.6 253.32 308.74
Federal Funds Rate 1.8 1.94 0.05 5.33
The variability observed in these statistics underscores the dynamic nature of economic
indicators and their collective influence on bond market fluctuations. For instance, the
high standard deviation of the Federal Funds Rate reflects significant monetary policy
adjustments during the study period, such as rate cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic
and subsequent rate hikes to curb inflation.
3.2.2 Data Preprocessing
To ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning analysis, several preprocessing
steps were implemented. These steps aimed to handle missing data, standardize variables,
and enhance the predictive power of the features through feature engineering.
1. Handling Missing Values:
o Missing values were identified in the raw dataset. For time series data,
maintaining temporal continuity is essential. Therefore, the forward-fill
12
method was employed to propagate the last observed value to subsequent
missing entries:
𝑥 = 𝑥 if 𝑥 is missing.
𝑡 𝑡−1 𝑡
o This approach preserves the temporal structure, particularly for variables
such as the Federal Funds Rate, which undergoes infrequent but
significant changes.
2. Standardization:
o To ensure variables with differing scales and units do not
disproportionately influence the model, standardization was applied:
𝑥 −μ
𝑧 =
σ
o where zzz is the standardized value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard
deviation. Standardization is particularly critical when combining
variables like inflation and interest rates, which have distinct scales.
3. Feature Engineering:
o A 30-day moving average (MA) of the 10-Year Treasury Yield was
created to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term
trends. This feature, denoted as DGS10_MA, is computed as follows:
𝑡
1
DGS10_MA = ∑ DGS10
𝑡 30 𝑖
𝑖=𝑡−29
o This transformation is valuable for detecting cyclical patterns and
providing a more stable input for machine learning models.
13
The preprocessed dataset was saved as a CSV file to ensure consistency across
subsequent analyses. Figure 3.1 illustrates the data preprocessing workflow, which
includes handling missing values, standardization, and feature engineering.
Figure 3.1: Data Preprocessing
The forward-fill method was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness in
maintaining the temporal structure of the dataset. However, this approach assumes
minimal variability between consecutive observations, which may not always hold for
volatile variables like interest rates.
Standardization enhances model performance by normalizing the range of each
feature, enabling machine learning models to converge more efficiently during training.
The moving average feature is particularly useful in time-series models as it reduces
noise and emphasizes meaningful trends, a crucial factor in financial forecasting [4].
These preprocessing steps ensure the dataset is well-prepared for machine
learning analysis, providing a robust foundation for the exploratory data analysis and
modeling efforts detailed in subsequent sections
14
3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to understand the structure of the
data, detect patterns, and identify relationships among variables before applying machine
learning models. Visualizations are extensively utilized in this section to explore the
dataset and provide insights into the distribution and correlations between different
economic indicators. This EDA phase helps to identify potential issues, such as skewness
or outliers, which could affect the performance of predictive models:
3.3.1 Distribution Analysis
Histograms were generated to visualize the distribution of each variable. Figure 3.2
shows that most values for the 10-Year Treasury Yield are concentrated between 1.5%
and 2.5%, indicating that the majority of yield values fall within this range. The
unemployment rate distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most values concentrated
around 4.0% to 6.0%. A few extreme values exceed 10.0%, likely corresponding to
economic recessions or periods of economic instability. The CPI distribution shows
several peaks, suggesting multiple periods of inflationary changes. The distribution
highlights the need to consider inflation’s non-linear effects on bond yields when
building predictive models. The distribution of the Federal Funds Rate reveals that most
values are clustered near zero, indicating an extended period of low interest rates. The 30-
day moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations in the 10-Year Treasury Yield,
revealing longer-term trends. The histogram shows a more compact distribution, with
most values concentrated between 1.6% and 2.4%. This distribution indicates that the
moving average helps reduce the impact of outliers and provides a clearer picture of the
15
yield’s central tendency. Overall, the histograms suggest that the data is not normally
distributed, with most variables exhibiting right-skewed distributions and varying degrees
of concentration. This insight indicates the need for potential data transformations, such
as logarithmic transformation or scaling, to improve model performance and achieve
better prediction results.
Figure 3.2: Histograms of Standardized Variables
3.3.2 Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was created to explore the relationships between variables, as shown
16
in Figure 3.3: Correlation Matrix of Economic Indicators. The correlation matrix provides
a visual representation of the strength and direction of the linear relationships between the
economic variables used in this study.
Figure 3.3 presents the correlation coefficients between the five selected variables: 10-
Year Treasury Yield (DGS10), Unemployment Rate (UNRATE), Consumer Price Index
(CPIAUCSL), Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS), and the 30-Day Moving Average of
the 10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10_MA). The matrix reveals the following key insights:
10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10) and Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS):
o There is a very strong positive correlation of 0.92 between the 10-Year Treasury
Yield and the Federal Funds Rate, indicating that changes in the Federal Funds Rate
have a significant impact on the long-term interest rates of 10-Year Treasury Bonds.
This suggests that monetary policy actions, reflected through adjustments in the
Federal Funds Rate, are closely tied to long-term borrowing costs in the market.
10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10) and Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL):
o The 10-Year Treasury Yield is positively correlated with the Consumer Price Index
(CPIAUCSL), with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. This indicates that higher
inflation, as measured by the CPI, tends to be associated with higher long-term
interest rates. Investors demand higher yields when inflation expectations rise,
leading to an increase in bond yields.
10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10) and 30-Day Moving Average (DGS10_MA):
o There is a high correlation of 0.82 between the 10-Year Treasury Yield and its 30-
day moving average, which is expected given that the moving average smooths out
17
short-term fluctuations and is inherently derived from the original yield data.
Unemployment Rate (UNRATE) and Other Indicators:
o The Unemployment Rate shows a negative correlation with most other variables,
particularly with the 10-Year Treasury Yield (-0.63) and the Federal Funds Rate (-
0.49). This suggests that higher unemployment is associated with lower bond yields
and interest rates, as central banks are more likely to implement accommodative
monetary policies (e.g., lowering rates) during periods of high unemployment to
stimulate economic growth.
Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL) and 30-Day Moving Average of 10-Year
Treasury Yield (DGS10_MA):
o The correlation coefficient between the Consumer Price Index and the 30-Day
Moving Average of the 10-Year Treasury Yield is 0.96, indicating a very strong
positive relationship. This suggests that inflation, as reflected by the CPI, has a
significant influence on the trend of long-term interest rates over time.
The overall matrix indicates that most variables exhibit moderate to strong correlations, with
the Federal Funds Rate and Consumer Price Index playing a central role in influencing the 10-
Year Treasury Yield. These findings highlight the interconnected nature of economic
indicators and their collective impact on bond market dynamics.
18
Figure 3.3: Correlation Matrix of Economic Indicators
3.3.3 Box Plot for Outlier Detection
Box plots were employed to detect outliers and assess the spread of each variable, as shown
in Figure 3.4. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from other observations,
indicating possible anomalies or unique economic events. Understanding and addressing
outliers is crucial for model performance, as they can disproportionately affect regression-
based models and skew the overall results.
10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10):
o The box plot of the 10-Year Treasury Yield shows a relatively symmetrical
19
distribution around the median, with a few outliers in the upper range. These
outliers are likely to correspond to periods of economic volatility or rapid changes
in long-term interest rates, possibly during times of economic recession or major
policy shifts. Given the significance of bond yields as an indicator of economic
health, these outliers warrant further investigation.
Unemployment Rate (UNRATE):
o The box plot of the Unemployment Rate reveals several distinct outliers above the
upper whisker. These outliers represent periods of unusually high unemployment,
which are typically observed during economic downturns or crises. Such extreme
values can impact models by skewing the mean and variance, so it is important to
consider strategies such as imputation or transformation to address these points.
Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL):
o The CPI box plot indicates a balanced distribution with no apparent extreme values
outside the whiskers. This suggests that inflation, as measured by the CPI, has been
relatively stable during the study period. The lack of significant outliers implies
that the CPI data is less likely to introduce volatility or unpredictability in the
predictive models.
Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS):
o The Federal Funds Rate exhibits a wider interquartile range (IQR), indicating
greater variability in short-term interest rates. The box plot does not show any
extreme outliers, suggesting that the Federal Reserve’s policy changes have been
within a predictable range. The spread of the Federal Funds Rate indicates that
monetary policy adjustments have been gradual rather than abrupt.
20
30-Day Moving Average of 10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10_MA):
o The box plot of the 30-Day Moving Average of the 10-Year Treasury Yield is
relatively compact, reflecting its smoothed nature compared to the original 10-Year
Treasury Yield. There are no visible outliers, which implies that using the moving
average can help reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and provide a more
stable representation of yield trends.
Figure 3.4: Box Plots of Standardized Economic indicators
The box plots reveal that, with the exception of the Unemployment Rate and 10-Year
Treasury Yield, most variables do not exhibit significant outliers. This suggests that the
dataset is generally well-behaved, with only a few instances of extreme values. Outlier
detection is a crucial step in the data preprocessing stage, as it helps ensure that the
models are not unduly influenced by these anomalies.
21
3.3.4 Time Series Analysis
A time series plot of the 10-Year Treasury Yield and its 30-day moving average was
created to observe temporal patterns and long-term trends, as shown in Figure 3.5. The
purpose of this analysis is to identify any seasonality, long-term trends, or abrupt changes
in the bond yield over time. Such insights are invaluable for model development and
understanding the dynamics of bond market movements.
To enhance the analysis, the decomposition of the time series into its components—
trend, seasonality, and residuals—was performed using STL (Seasonal-Trend
decomposition using Loess).
The decomposition model is expressed as:
Y(t)= T(t) + S(t) + R(t)
where:
• T(t): Long-term trend component, representing the overall direction of bond yields.
• S(t): Seasonal component, capturing periodic fluctuations (e.g., quarterly or annual
cycles).
• R(t): Residual component, representing irregular variations not explained by the
trend or seasonality.
22
Figure 3.5: Time Series Plot of 10-Year Treasury Yield and 30-Day Moving Average
Figure 3.5 reveals the following key observations:
Trends and Fluctuations in the 10-Year Treasury Yield:
o The time series plot of the 10-Year Treasury Yield shows distinct upward and
downward trends over the study period from 2019 to 2024. From the beginning of
2019 until mid-2020, there was a noticeable decline in bond yields, reaching a
minimum around early 2021. This decline likely corresponds to the Federal
Reserve’s actions in response to economic instability and uncertainty during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
o After mid-2021, the yield begins to recover, exhibiting a gradual upward trend,
which accelerates significantly from 2022 onward. This increase could be attributed
to rising inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary
policy. Such patterns indicate that external factors, such as monetary policy and
macroeconomic conditions, play a significant role in influencing bond yield
23
movements.
Smoothing Effect of the 30-Day Moving Average:
o The 30-day moving average (orange dashed line) provides a smoothed
representation of the 10-Year Treasury Yield by reducing short-term fluctuations.
The moving average closely follows the overall trend of the original yield but
eliminates some of the noise and volatility observed in the raw data.
o This smoothing effect highlights long-term trends more clearly and can serve as a
benchmark for identifying major turning points in the bond market.
Seasonal Patterns and Volatility:
o The time series plot suggests potential seasonal patterns, particularly in the frequent
fluctuations observed in 2023. However, additional seasonal decomposition is
required to confirm the presence of seasonality. Volatility also appears to increase
towards the end of the study period, indicating a higher level of uncertainty and
market activity.
Impact of External Events:
o The significant drop in yields during 2020 aligns with the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic and subsequent economic shutdowns. Similarly, the sharp rise in yields
from 2022 corresponds to rising inflation concerns and aggressive rate hikes by the
Federal Reserve. These observations underscore the sensitivity of bond yields to
external economic events and policy changes.
Overall, the time series analysis illustrates that the 10-Year Treasury Yield is highly
dynamic, with trends that reflect underlying economic conditions and monetary policy
24
decisions. The use of a 30-day moving average enhances the interpretability of these
trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations.
3.4 Experimental Design and Evaluation Criteria
The experimental design aims to evaluate the performance of different machine learning
models in predicting bond market trends. The models utilized in this study include
Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Regressor.
Each model was chosen based on its unique ability to handle time series data and capture
nonlinear relationships between economic variables and bond yields. The evaluation
metrics listed below were employed to measure model performance and provide a
comprehensive assessment:
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between
actual and predicted values. It penalizes larger errors more severely, making it
sensitive to outliers. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.

2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, which provides a
measure of the average error magnitude in the same unit as the dependent variable.
RMSE is easier to interpret compared to MSE and gives an estimate of the
prediction error.

3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average absolute difference
between the actual and predicted values. Unlike MSE, MAE treats all errors equally,
providing a more robust measure of model performance when dealing with outliers.
𝑛

MAE = ∑|𝑦 −𝑦̂|
𝑛 𝑖 𝑖

4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Measures the percentage deviation
between actual and predicted values. It is particularly useful for comparing
prediction accuracy across different models or datasets with varying scales.

5. Adjusted R²: Indicates the proportion of the variance explained by the independent
variables, adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. This metric provides
a better measure of goodness-of-fit compared to R², especially when multiple
variables are used.

Where:
• n: The total number of observations or data points in the sample.
• k: The number of independent variables (predictors) included in the model.
• 𝑅2: The traditional coefficient of determination, representing the proportion of
variance explained by the model.
6. Theil's U Statistic: Measures predictive efficiency by comparing the forecasting
accuracy of a given model against a naïve model (e.g., the previous period’s value).
26
A Theil’s U value less than 1 indicates that the model has predictive power greater
than the naïve forecast.

Implementation of Evaluation Metrics: The evaluation metrics were implemented using
the following code:
Figure 3.6: Evaluation Metrics
Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
To ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models, a 5-fold cross-validation
strategy was employed. Cross-validation helps mitigate the risk of overfitting by
partitioning the dataset into multiple folds and averaging the performance across these
folds. Cross-validation divides the dataset into k folds, where each fold serves as a test set
once while the remaining k−1folds are used for training. The error is calculated as:
𝑘
1
𝐶𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 = ∑Error(Fold )
𝑘 𝑖
𝑖=1
27
Each model was trained and validated on different subsets of the data, and the average
performance across all folds was reported as the result.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for the SVM and
Random Forest models to identify the optimal configuration of model parameters. The
objective function minimized during tuning is:
𝑛
1 2
𝑂𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑠 = Θ ∑(𝑦 −𝑓(𝑥 ,Θ))
argmin𝑛 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖=1
where Θ represents the model hyperparameters.
This process involved evaluating combinations of different hyperparameters (e.g., C
and gamma for SVM, and n_estimators and max_depth for Random Forest) using cross-
validation. The best set of parameters, which minimized the MSE, was selected as the
final model configuration.
Figure 3.7: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Rolling Window Analysis
To assess the temporal stability of the models, a rolling window analysis was conducted.
In this approach, the model is trained on a fixed window of historical data (e.g., 12
months) and tested on the next period (e.g., the subsequent month). The window then
shifts forward by one period, and the process is repeated. This method helps evaluate how
the model performs over different time periods and economic conditions.
28
Visualization of Model Predictions
To visually compare the model predictions with the actual values, scatter plots and
residual plots were generated. These visualizations provide additional insights into model
performance, highlighting areas where the model’s predictions deviate significantly from
the actual values.
3.5 Summary
This chapter provided a detailed description of the research methodology, covering data
collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection,
experimental design, and evaluation criteria. The chapter also presented the
implementation of various machine learning models and their evaluation using multiple
performance metrics, including MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Adjusted R². Cross-
validation, hyperparameter tuning, and rolling window analysis were utilized to ensure the
robustness and reliability of the models. The next chapter will present the experimental
results and discuss the implications of the findings for bond market forecasting and
financial decision-making.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models—
including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest
Regressor—applied to bond market data to predict the 10-Year Treasury Yield. The
primary aim is to assess the performance, feasibility, and effectiveness of these models in
capturing the complex relationships between economic indicators and bond market
fluctuations. Each model's unique capabilities in handling the underlying relationships
between economic variables and the target variable are examined.
The models were assessed using multiple evaluation metrics to provide a detailed
comparison and a comprehensive understanding of their predictive capabilities and
limitations [1]. The chapter emphasizes the experimental results, exploring the significance
of hyperparameter tuning and the impact of different configurations on model performance
[2]. Furthermore, cross-validation and residual analysis are employed to ensure the
robustness of the results and to provide further insights into model behavior.
This analysis contributes to our understanding of how machine learning models can
be employed for financial forecasting and decision-making. The chapter concludes with a
discussion of key findings, highlighting implications for the field of finance and providing
recommendations for future research.

4.2 Evaluation of Machine Learning Models
This section provides an in-depth analysis of the performance of the Linear Regression,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest models. The models were evaluated
using several key performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE), and Adjusted R².
4.2.1 Linear Regression Analysis
Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a
dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear function [3]. It
models the relationship between a dependent variable (the target variable) and one or
more independent variables by assuming that this relationship can be expressed as a
straight line. The fundamental assumption is that there is a linear relationship between the
independent variables and the dependent variable. The mathematical formulation of the
linear regression model is given by:
𝑦 = β +β 𝑥 +β 𝑥 +⋯+β 𝑥 +ϵ
0 1 1 2 2 𝑛 𝑛
where:
• 𝑦 is the dependent variable (10-Year Treasury Yield),
• β is the interception,
0
• β ,β ,…,β are the coefficients for the independent variables 𝑋 ,𝑋 ,…,𝑋
1 2 𝑛 1 2 𝑛
• ϵ is the error term.
Linear Regression is often employed as a baseline model due to its simplicity and
interpretability. It works well for datasets where the relationships between variables are
31
approximately linear. However, it struggles with capturing complex nonlinear
interactions, which are often present in financial data [2].
The results of the linear regression model are presented below:
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1947
• Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0548
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2341
• Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 35.48%
• R² Score: 0.9468
The high R² value indicates that the linear regression model can explain approximately
94.68% of the variance in the 10-Year Treasury Yield, making it a strong predictor.
Figure 4.1 illustrates the actual vs. predicted values for the linear regression model. The
data points are closely aligned with the perfect fit line, suggesting that the model captures
the overall trend effectively. However, the residuals in Figure 4.2 indicate some patterns,
implying that linear regression might not be sufficient to capture all nonlinear
relationships in the dataset.

4.2.2 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Analysis
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning model commonly used for both
classification and regression tasks. The core idea of SVM is to find an optimal
hyperplane that separates data points of different classes (in classification) or fits the data
points (in regression) with the maximum margin [9]. The objective function of SVM can
be represented as:
𝑛
1
min( |w|2 +𝐶∑ξ )
𝑤,𝑏,ξ 2 𝑖
𝑖=1
subject to the constraint:
𝑦 (w⋅x +𝑏) ≥ 1−ξ , ξ ≥ 0
𝑖 i 𝑖 𝑖
where:
• w is the weight vector,
• 𝑏 is the bias term,
• 𝐶 is the regularization parameter,
• 𝜉 are slack variables that allow for some misclassification in the data,
𝑖
• 𝑦 are the target values,
𝑖
• x are the feature vectors.
i
The results of the SVM model are as follows:
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.2424
• Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0768
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2771
• Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 46.39%
• R² Score: 0.9255
34
The SVM model's lower R² score and higher error metrics compared to linear regression
suggest that SVM might not be the most suitable model for this dataset, possibly due to
its sensitivity to noise and parameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
was employed to find the optimal combination of 𝐶 and γ
values. The best parameters identified were C=10 and γ=auto. Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4
display the actual vs. predicted values and residuals for the SVM model.

35

4.2.3 Random Forest Regressor Analysis
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple
decision trees to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. The model can be
represented as:
𝑇
1
𝑦̂ = ∑ℎ (𝑥)
𝑇 𝑡
𝑡=1
where:
• 𝑦̂ is the final prediction,
• 𝑇 is the number of decision trees,
• ℎ (𝑥) is the prediction from the t-th tree.
𝑡
Each decision tree ℎ (𝑥) in the Random Forest is constructed using the following steps:
𝑡
36
1. Bootstrap Sampling: A random subset of the dataset is created by sampling with
replacement. This ensures diversity among the decision trees.
2. Random Feature Selection: At each split in the tree, a random subset of features
is selected. The feature that minimizes the impurity, calculated using measures
such as the Gini Index or Information Gain, is chosen:
𝐶
𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 = 1−∑𝑝2
𝑖
𝑖=1
where C is the number of classes and 𝑝 is the proportion of samples belonging to
i
class 𝑖 in the node.
3. Tree Growth: The tree is grown to its maximum depth or until a predefined
stopping criterion (e.g., minimum samples per leaf) is met.
The final prediction is the average of the predictions from all T decision trees, which
reduces the variance and enhances robustness.
The results of the Random Forest model are:
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1781
• Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0515
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2270
• Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 37.33%
• R² Score: 0.9500
The Random Forest model achieves the best performance among the three models, as
evidenced by the lowest MSE and highest R² score. This suggests that it is highly
effective at capturing complex relationships in the dataset. Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6
37
show the actual vs. predicted values and residuals, respectively, showing minimal errors
and high predictive accuracy.

38
4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation
Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in machine learning model development, as it
optimizes model performance by identifying the most suitable configuration of
parameters. In this study, GridSearchCV was employed for hyperparameter tuning of the
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest models. GridSearchCV
systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter values to find the
combination that minimizes the error metric—in this case, the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) [10].
For the Support Vector Machine, the following hyperparameters were considered:
• C: Regularization parameter, which controls the trade-off between maximizing
the margin and minimizing classification error.
• γ: Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’, and ‘sigmoid’. It defines how far the
influence of a single training example reaches, with a lower value indicating that
the influence is spread out across multiple points.
• Kernel: Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm (e.g., linear,
polynomial, RBF).
The optimal hyperparameters obtained from GridSearchCV were:
• C=10
• γ=auto
• Kernel = ‘rbf’
These values resulted in the lowest MSE during cross-validation, indicating the best fit
for the dataset. Figure 4.7 presents the GridSearchCV results, showing the performance
39
of different parameter combinations on the validation set. Similarly, the performance of
the Random Forest model was enhanced by adjusting the number of trees and maximum
depth, thereby reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
For the Random Forest, the following hyperparameters were considered:
• Number of estimators: The number of trees in the forest.
• Maximum depth: The maximum depth of each tree.
• Minimum samples split: The minimum number of samples required to split an
internal node.
• Minimum samples leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf
node.
After performing GridSearchCV, the best combination of hyperparameters was found to
be:
• n_estimators=100
• max_depth=10
• min_samples_split=2
• min_samples_leaf=1
The tuned Random Forest model demonstrated an improved performance, as evidenced
by lower error metrics and higher R² values compared to the baseline model
configuration.
40

4.3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by partitioning
the dataset into multiple folds. In each iteration, one fold is used as a test set while the
remaining folds are used as training sets. The process is repeated until each fold has
served as a test set, and the results are averaged to produce a final evaluation metric. This
study used a 5-fold cross-validation approach to reduce the risk of overfitting and ensure
that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
The cross-validation results for the tuned models are summarized as follows:
41
• Support Vector Machine: Achieved an average MSE of 0.1027 across the 5
folds, indicating that the model is effective in capturing the underlying patterns in
the dataset.
• Random Forest: Achieved an average MSE of 0.0515, demonstrating that the
ensemble method is superior in terms of predictive accuracy.
4.4 Residual Analysis and Model Interpretation
Residual analysis involves examining the difference between actual and predicted values
to assess model performance. Ideally, residuals should be randomly distributed around
zero, indicating that the model has no systematic bias and captures all relevant
information in the data.
Figures 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6 present the residual plots for Linear Regression, SVM, and
Random Forest models:
• Linear Regression: The residuals are distributed around zero but show some
noticeable patterns, suggesting that the linear model may not be sufficient for
capturing nonlinear relationships in the dataset.
• Support Vector Machine: The residuals exhibit less variability compared to
linear regression, but some structures are still visible, indicating that the SVM
model could be improved further by adjusting hyperparameters or incorporating
additional features.
• Random Forest: The residuals are the most randomly distributed, indicating that
the Random Forest model captures the complex interactions between variables
and provides the most accurate predictions.
42
These residual plots confirm that Random Forest is the best-performing model, as it
shows minimal bias and random distribution of residuals.
4.4.1 Model Performance Analysis
The performance of the three models—Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and Random Forest—can be evaluated using several error metrics, each
reflecting a different aspect of model performance. Below is a detailed analysis of each
model’s performance based on the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE), and 𝑅2 Score.
Table 4.1. Model Performance Table
Model MAE MSE RMSE MAPE 𝑅2SCORE
Linear Regression 0.1947 0.0548 0.2341 35.48% 0.9468
Support Vector Machine 0.2424 0.0768 0.2771 46.39% 0.9255
Random Forest 0.1781 0.0515 0.2270 37.33% 0.9500
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
MAE is a simple but effective measure of prediction accuracy, as it represents the
average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MAE
indicates that the model has less error in its predictions on average. In this analysis:
43
• Random Forest achieves the lowest MAE of 0.1781, meaning that, on average,
the model's predictions deviate from the actual bond yields by around 0.1781
percentage points.
• Linear Regression follows with an MAE of 0.1947.
• SVM has the highest MAE of 0.2424, indicating that it has the least accuracy in
terms of absolute prediction errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
MSE squares the error before averaging, which emphasizes larger errors more than
smaller ones. A model with a lower MSE is preferable because it shows that large
deviations between actual and predicted values are infrequent.
• Random Forest outperforms both Linear Regression and SVM with the lowest
MSE of 0.0515, which confirms that this model is the best at minimizing large
prediction errors.
• Linear Regression has an MSE of 0.0548, slightly higher than Random Forest.
• SVM has the highest MSE of 0.0768, indicating that it struggles to minimize
large errors compared to the other two models.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RMSE is the square root of MSE, providing an error measure in the same units as the
target variable, making it easier to interpret. A lower RMSE indicates better model
performance:
• Random Forest once again achieves the best performance with an RMSE of
0.2270, indicating that, on average, the model’s predictions deviate from actual
bond yields by 0.2270 percentage points.
44
• Linear Regression performs similarly with an RMSE of 0.2341, but it is slightly
worse than Random Forest.
• SVM has the highest RMSE of 0.2771, confirming that it struggles to produce
accurate predictions compared to the other models.
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
MAPE measures the prediction error as a percentage of the actual values, which is
particularly useful for comparing models across different scales or units:
• Random Forest achieves a reasonable MAPE of 37.33%, indicating that, on
average, the model's predictions are off by 37.33% from the actual bond yields.
• Linear Regression has a similar but slightly worse MAPE of 35.48%, which
indicates that its percentage deviation from actual values is similar to that of
Random Forest.
• SVM has the highest MAPE at 46.39%, showing that this model produces the
least accurate predictions in terms of percentage error.
R² Score
The R² score indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is
explained by the independent variables. A higher R2R^2R2 score signifies better model
performance:
• Random Forest achieves the highest R² score of 0.9500, meaning that the model
explains 95% of the variance in the bond yields, making it the most effective
model for predicting bond market trends.
• Linear Regression follows with an R² score of 0.9468, which is quite close to
that of Random Forest, suggesting it is still a fairly strong model.
45
• SVM has the lowest R² score at 0.9255, indicating that it explains only 92.55% of
the variance, and thus it is the least effective model for this dataset.
4.4.2 Discussion of Experimental Results
The findings suggest that the Random Forest model is the most effective in predicting
bond market trends, followed closely by linear regression. The SVM model, despite its
flexibility, performed less consistently. The high variance and sensitivity to parameter
settings are likely reasons for its underperformance in comparison to Random Forest.
Overall, the results indicate that machine learning models can be highly effective for
financial forecasting, with ensemble methods such as Random Forest providing robust
and reliable predictions. The detailed evaluation and comparison of these models
contribute to a deeper understanding of how different techniques can be leveraged to
predict economic trends.
4.5 Summary
In this chapter, the performance of three machine learning models—Linear Regression,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—was evaluated on predicting bond
market trends using a set of economic indicators. The analysis was based on key
evaluation metrics, including MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² Score.
The Random Forest model was found to consistently outperform the others,
showing the lowest error rates and highest R² score, indicating its superior ability to
capture complex relationships in the dataset. Linear Regression, while effective for
simpler, linear relationships, struggled with the more nuanced patterns, and SVM was
46
observed to demonstrate the least accuracy among the three, suggesting that further
tuning or more advanced kernels may be required.
The findings highlight that while simpler models like Linear Regression can
provide some insights, more advanced algorithms like Random Forest are necessary for
robust financial forecasting. Future research could explore more complex models and
additional features to further enhance prediction accuracy.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS
5.1 Overview of Findings and Practical Implications
The results from applying machine learning models to bond market prediction reveal
important insights into model performance, offering practical implications for investors,
policymakers, and financial analysts. Among the three models evaluated—Linear
Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—Random Forest
emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the lowest error rates (MAE, MSE,
RMSE, MAPE) and the highest 𝑅2 score. Its ability to capture non-linear relationships
between key economic indicators, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, inflation, and
unemployment rates, demonstrated its suitability for complex financial markets.
Linear Regression, while computationally efficient, showed limitations in capturing
the intricate, non-linear interactions in the dataset. Though it performed relatively well, its
moderate accuracy highlights the challenges linear models face in dynamic financial
markets where variables interact in non-linear ways.
SVM, though a more sophisticated model than Linear Regression, underperformed
due to difficulties in optimizing hyperparameters and kernel functions. This suggests that
SVM requires more extensive tuning and may not be the most practical option for this type
of financial data without deeper model optimization efforts.
From a practical standpoint, these results underscore the advantages of ensemble
methods like Random Forest in financial forecasting. Investors and analysts can benefit
from the enhanced accuracy of ensemble models, which combine multiple decision trees
48
to handle complex, non-linear relationships in bond market data. Additionally, the strong
correlation between bond yields and economic indicators like the Federal Funds Rate and
inflation suggests that these variables are critical for prediction accuracy, making feature
selection an important consideration for improving model performance.
5.2 Limitations and Challenges
Despite the promising results, several limitations must be considered:
Data Constraints: The dataset used for this study spans only from 2019 to 2023,
limiting its ability to capture long-term bond market trends. Furthermore, the
scope of economic variables included was relatively narrow. Incorporating more
diverse features, such as geopolitical events or market sentiment data, could
enhance the robustness of the models.
Model Complexity and Real-Time Forecasting: While Random Forest
performed well in this study, its complexity and computational demands could be
problematic for real-time prediction tasks. Future research could focus on
optimizing model efficiency or exploring alternative ensemble techniques like
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) to reduce computational costs without
sacrificing accuracy.
Assumptions in Preprocessing: The preprocessing techniques used, such as
forward-filling missing values and standardizing features, may introduce biases
into the models. Alternative approaches, such as advanced imputation methods or
49
feature engineering, could provide more accurate results and improve model
reliability.
5.3 Future Research Directions
Building upon the findings and addressing the limitations of this study, several promising
directions for future research are proposed:
1. Exploration of Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
Future research could investigate the application of advanced machine learning
models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-
suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. Additionally,
hybrid models that combine statistical approaches (e.g., ARIMA) with machine
learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) could provide a
more holistic framework for modeling the complex interactions in bond market
dynamics. These approaches could address the limitations of the current models in
capturing long-term trends and seasonality.
2. Expansion of the Feature Set
Incorporating a broader set of economic, political, and sentiment-based features
could significantly enhance the models’ predictive power. For instance,
geopolitical events, central bank communications, and macroeconomic policy
shifts are critical drivers of bond market fluctuations. Utilizing Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data, such as news articles, social
media sentiment, or investor reports, could provide additional layers of contextual
50
information. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of how external
factors influence bond yields.
3. Time-Series Specific Validation Methods
Implementing rolling window validation could improve the robustness and
generalizability of machine learning models. This method involves training
models on one time window and testing them on the subsequent period, offering
insights into how models perform across different economic cycles and during
periods of policy shifts or market volatility. Such validation techniques would
also help identify temporal weaknesses in the models and provide a clearer
understanding of their practical applicability.
By addressing these research directions, future studies can overcome the current
limitations and further enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of machine
learning models for bond market forecasting.
5.4 Contributions and Conclusion
This study makes several key contributions to the field of financial analytics. By
demonstrating the application of machine learning models—particularly ensemble
methods such as Random Forest—in bond market forecasting, this research provides
valuable insights into the role of data-driven approaches in navigating the complexities of
financial markets. The findings underscore the effectiveness of Random Forest in
capturing non-linear relationships and highlight the critical influence of variables like
inflation and interest rates on bond yields. Moreover, the study offers practical
51
implications for investors and policymakers, showcasing how machine learning models
can support decision-making in volatile economic environments.
While Random Forest emerged as the most effective model in this study, the research
also acknowledges its limitations, including the need for large datasets and computational
resources. Future research should investigate the integration of advanced machine
learning techniques, such as deep learning (e.g., LSTM or GRU networks), hybrid time-
series models, or Bayesian approaches, to address these limitations and enhance
prediction accuracy. Additionally, incorporating broader economic variables, such as
geopolitical factors or market sentiment derived from news or social media, could further
refine forecasting capabilities. Improving model interpretability through explainable AI
techniques (e.g., SHAP or LIME) is another promising direction that could make these
methods more accessible and actionable for financial practitioners.
In conclusion, this study illustrates the transformative potential of machine learning in
bond market forecasting, offering both theoretical contributions and practical tools for
navigating the complexities of modern financial markets. By advancing both predictive
accuracy and model applicability, this research lays a foundation for future innovations in
data-driven financial decision-making.

Similarly, to all methods, which use ratio indicators,
the Taffler index also reached relatively high extreme

In terms of the IN 05 index, a large number of
enterprises had to be excluded from testing, as the
results often reported a logical error (division by

the IN 05 index achieved relatively good results,
especially in the period of one and two years before
bankruptcy, as shown in Figure 2. This is confirmed
by the comparison of median values, where a

These values did not show any significant deviations
for the period of four years before bankruptcy.

Predictive Analytics: Mitigating Risks in Fintech
Products with AI
Chintamani Bagwe
Citibank, Texas, USA
Abstract- In Fintech, predictive analytics play an important role in dealing with increasing complexity in the financial sphere,
radically altering risk assessment and hence the nature of financial choices. This paper examines the interaction between
cutting-edge predictive analytics and artificial intelligence in promoting corporate risk assessment, fraud detection, and
operational productivity in solution providers. It discusses a number of predictive analytics models, such as time set
classification and neural networks and uses them to think through market trends, customer clustering behaviour, and anomaly
identification. The identification links are then used in many financial service scenarios to consider their impact on risk
solvency development and customer experience and to predict market patterns. The paper looks at difficulties in data
administration, illustration, and ethics, and suggests a solid data management approach and an ethical concept. It concludes
with thoughts and ideas that would lead to more risk awareness and AI-driven decisions in the future, and highlights the
predicted growth in competitively elegant predictive forecasting and situation control. The sense-the essay makes is to remind
Fintech managers and specialists of the importance of keeping their learning up-to-date to take full advantage of the most
recent advances in artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to make sensible decisions and policy thinking in their career.
